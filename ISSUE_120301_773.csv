Two bug fixes for sqlite3 database connector,"1) In the first instance, an invalid database configuration can sometimes result in a failure to connect to the SQLite database without an error. As no error is caught by CakePhP, PhP itself throws a fatal error on line 221 as no $connection object exists. This bug fix forces the _execute() function to check that the database is in fact connected - if not, CakePhP gracefully throws a helpful error message to the user.

Reported here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4779007/cakephp-and-sqlite-fatal-error-call-to-a-member-function-query-on-a-non-obje, here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7107996/fatal-error-call-to-a-member-function-query-on-a-non-object-in-var-www-likes, and here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7572091/error-while-trying-to-connect-to-sqlite3-database-from-cakephp
To reproduce: set $config['connect'] to an invalid value.

2) In the second instance, the sqlite driver ignores SQL views. Changing the SQL query to read ""SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table' OR type='view'"" where it previously read just ""type='table'"" fixes this problem.

All the best,

Daniel

Chrome returns 0 for slide width/height,"This is probably caused by WebKit not returning width or height information for images until they're loaded, which means that when Cycles creates the slideshow and sets it up into buildOptions() the dimensions of the image will be 0. This also means it's probably affecting Safari as well, although I can't confirm myself [see links].

I believe there's some code in buildOptions() trying to deal with this judging by this comment ""// apparently a lot of people use image slideshows without height/width attributes on the images."" but unfortunately it doesn't seem to work properly.

I think the ideal solution would probably be to decouple slideshow creation and setup from actual image manipulation and display a ""Loading..."" spinner while the images are being loaded and manipulated into place.

Possible to disable for a single request to allow streaming?,"I have been attempting to get streaming working in Rails 3.2 on Heroku (see my SO post here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9915704/rails-3-2-streaming).

I am coming to the conclusion that rack-cache is causing the problem. Disabling it using config.middleware.delete(Rack::Cache) in production.rb seems to fix it. This, obviously, disables it for my entire app.

I only want it disabled for the one streaming request (which is on the admin side and will be used infrequently). It'd be a major bummer to lose caching for the sake of one small (but required) admin feature.

Are there any work-arounds for this? Thanks!

Add W3C Touch support for mobile browsers,"This library does not currently support the ""touch"" events necessary for it to work on mobile browsers.

Adding support for mobile browsers also introduces extra complexity as the whole text selection interface works much differently than that of a desktop browser: i.e. long tap to select a word, then drag the cursor ends to expand it to your desired selection range.  It may not be possible to achieve the desired parity for mobile browsers as they probably don't fire additional events for that selection expansion activity (boo!).

Start with this touch detection technique leveraged from jQuery Mobile:

``` js
var touchSupported = $.support.touch || ""ontouchend"" in document;

What I did was to change the Gemfile.lock to ""Ruby 1.0.0.beta.4.1"" which seems to have solved the problem as far as the install goes.  I'm still very new to Rails (and GitHub for that matter), so I don't know if this appropriate for a pull request or an issue.

We can make this Android,"After some thought, we can make the referral game in Android after all. We should use the firstInstallTime to get when the app was first installed, correlate with when a link was hit by a QR-code (with a little bit of basic geo-info) and that should be solid enough to correlate an app install with the parent referrer.

We can't do anything at install time, but we can do things as soon as the app is first launched. If we do it this way, the whole thing should work. You maybe don't get points until the person starts the app for the first time, which is also not spammable, or only get 1 point when a link is hit, and another couple points when they run it.

Bottle should have per request local storage,"Hi,

After some discussion on IRC and Stackoverflow\* regarding reuse of request objects (bottle.request) and thread local (bottle.local) there were identified a need for some sort of per request local storage.

Use case:

In my code I validate login tokens (cookies with session ID or similar) in a generic routing at the beginning of each request before control is handed back to the defined route handling procedure. The token validation is implemented as a decorator called @restricted.

In order to separate the generic code and the route handling I have added an attribute to the request object that holds any user information after token validation so I can use this in the route handling procedures later. To remove redundant database lookups I have also added code to check whether this attribute exists in the request object already.

Problem:

Since request objects are reused, validation will only happen once. Depending on the web server, this might even introduce a security vulnerability.

Using bottle.local would fix the problem for my specific implementation, but any multiplexed IO based server (non-blocking server) might treat the bottle.local storage as ""global"".

Suggested solution:

Adding some sort of request-local storage area that is guaranteed to only be accessible from the current request, no matter web server implementation.

Function to sort a substitution dictionary to remove ambiguity,"See https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/690 .  There should be a way to take a dictionary and sort it so that when passed to subs, the substitution happens in order.  For example, if you have

`(x*y).subs({y: z, z:2})`, you might get `x*z` or `2*x`, depending on the order of the substitution.  The function should order the dictionary to give you the latter order.  

The idea is to use a topological sort.  The dictionary contains old:new pairs.  Each pair is a node in the graph.  Node A points to Node B if Node A's old contains Node B's new (that is to say, Node A ""depends"" on Node B).  The topological sort will put the nodes in order so that the dependencies are handled in order (if possible).  

One issue is what is meant by ""contains"".  We could just use .has, but that only does literal containment, whereas .subs goes beyond that (e.g., `(x**4).subs(x**2, y)` => `y**2`). So I guess we need a function to check if an expression ""contains"" another in the subs sense, that is, expression A ""contains"" expression B if A.subs(B, Dummy).has(Dummy).  We could just use that, but we could also probably be more efficient (though maybe not without a rewrite of the structure of subs, which we need to do anyway).

As for the topological sort, it's already implemented in sympy/utilities/iterables.py.

Finally, there's the question of whether subs should apply this function automatically when given a dictionary as input (which has the terms unordered, so is potentially ambiguous), or if that should be up to the user to do.

better unification for compound types,"See bug #1 in the context of this mailing list post:

""1. It will not choose the correct implicit function for any type after 
the first type in the destination disjunction.""

The link below is an improved implementation that has the same bug, is less complex to follow, and thus if I am correct probably demonstrates that the problem is not peculiar to a simulated union type and rather general to implicits and compound type leaf nodes (i.e. those after the first `with`, e.g. the `D[String]` in `D[D[Int] with D[String]]`), when the implicit matching is in the contravariant direction. The `neg` implicit is chosen for `D[D[Int]]` but not for `D[D[String]]`.

Inconsistencies vs. Native Regarding Invalidation,"There's some disconnect between ABS and the native action bar when creating and invalidating menus in a manner consistent with a `ViewPager`'s operation.

The following example will exhibit all the problems (assets can be found in the [guages for android](https://github.com/github/gauges-android) repo)

``` java
public class ABSBuggggssActivity extends SherlockFragmentActivity {
    boolean mShow = true;

    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        Button b = new Button(this);
        b.setOnClickListener(new OnClickListener() {
            public void onClick(View v) {
                mShow = !mShow;
                invalidateOptionsMenu();
            }
        });
        setContentView(b);
    }

    public boolean onCreateOptionsMenu(Menu menu) {
        if (mShow) {
            menu.add(""Refresh"").setIcon(R.drawable.ic_action_refresh).setShowAsAction(MenuItem.SHOW_AS_ACTION_IF_ROOM);
        }
        return true;
    }

    public boolean onMenuItemSelected(int featureId, MenuItem item) {
        ImageView iv = (ImageView) LayoutInflater.from(this).inflate(R.layout.refresh_action_view, null);
        Animation r = AnimationUtils.loadAnimation(this, R.anim.clockwise_refresh);
        r.setRepeatCount(Animation.INFINITE);
        iv.startAnimation(r);
        item.setActionView(iv);
        return true;
    }
}
```

On ICS you'll get the rendering issue when clicking the action item, and then toggling the action item visibility with the content button.

![](https://img.skitch.com/20120303-rw9dq1xwqh9eu9n275ngb5g4e5.jpg)

If you change to use a native `Activity` (and correct the menu imports) you'll observe the bug does not occur. If you return `false` when the menu doesn't exist (as you should) it will work with `SherlockFragmentActivity` but we still want to mimic native.

Use pre-Honeycomb always exhibits the rendering problem no matter what you return. This is likely due to `FragmentActivity`'s handling of menus since it thinks we want to use it rather than our own implementation.

ARC support?,"Hiyas

I don't think this can be considered an issue, but is it planned to support ARC in the future? The problem is, that even in a project where ARC is enabled and PdfKitten is excluded, a project still doesn't compile because of things like NSMutableString*\* rawTextContent (Scanner.h) for example. Every ARC enabled project gets freaky when it should compile this class (even if PdfKitten is excluded).

iOS: input labels don't focus on associated fields,"## Summary

Tapping a `label` doesn't put focus in the associated input field in iOS.
## Platforms

iOS
## How to Reproduce

Add  
    `<label for=""field"">Label</label>
     <input id=""field"" type=""text"" />`

In normal browsers, clicking on the label will focus you in the associated field declared by the `for` attribute. However, tapping the label in iOS does nothing.

as a way to force web browsers to not treat the returned data as utf-8.  This is useful if you are doing something like trying to fetch an image in web browsers and also would like that same code to work in node.

Currently, this library forces the data stream to be interpreted as utf-8 which is potentially lossy, and definitely lossy in the case of png images.  Specifically, the first byte 0x89 when round-tripped through utf-8 gets converted into the replacement character 0xffd and comes back (utf-8 encoded) as 0xef 0xbf 0xbd.

Usage of super in ptyhandler.py,"As said in the meeting the code is written with old style classe in mind and super should be only be used in new style classes.

Link to the code line: https://github.com/rainerf/ricodebug/blob/master/src/helpers/ptyhandler.py#L33

Use cases for super from the python 2.7 Documentation (http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html?highlight=super#super)

> There are two typical use cases for super. In a class hierarchy with single inheritance, super can be used to refer to parent classes without naming them explicitly, thus making the code more maintainable. This use closely parallels the use of super in other programming languages.
> 
> The second use case is to support cooperative multiple inheritance in a dynamic execution environment. This use case is unique to Python and is not found in statically compiled languages or languages that only support single inheritance. This makes it possible to implement “diamond diagrams” where multiple base classes implement the same method. Good design dictates that this method have the same calling signature in every case (because the order of calls is determined at runtime, because that order adapts to changes in the class hierarchy, and because that order can include sibling classes hat are unknown prior to runtime).

In iOS5 Safari: `position: relative` (or possibly all positioned) child elements occasionally disappear while scrolling an element that uses `-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch`. They seem to consistently reappear after scroll stops. This seems to occur most with elements that are outside of the overflow region at scroll start.

- iOS5
## How to reproduce:
1. Set overflow: auto and  `-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch` on an element that has `position: relative` child elements and a lot of content

Android 2.2/2.3’s Native Browser and Fixed Positioning,"Android 2.2/2.3’s implementation of <code>position: fixed;</code> can, in conjunction with seemingly unrelated styles and markup patterns, cause a number of strange issues—particularly in the case of <code>position: absolute</code> elements inside of <code>position: fixed</code> elements. These bizarre issues include—but are not limited to—the following:
- Form elements elsewhere on the page—select menus in particular—can fail to respond to user interaction when an <em>empty</em> absolute positioned element is placed within a fixed position element. In rare cases—and specific to Android 2.2—this can cause <em>entire pages</em> to fail to respond to user interaction. This can seemingly be solved by adding any character to the absolute positioned element, including a non-breaking space, and in some cases even whitespace.
- The above-described issue can also be triggered by an absolute positioned image inside of a fixed position element, but <em>only</em> when that image is using something <em>other than its inherent dimensions</em>. If a height or width is specified on the image using CSS, or the image src is invalid (thus having no inherent height and width), this issue can occur. If an image that is inherently, say, 50x50 pixels is placed in a fixed element and left at its inherent dimensions, this issue does not seem to occur.
- When a <code>position: fixed</code> element appears anywhere on a page, most 2D CSS transforms will fail. Oddly, only <code>translate</code> transforms seem uneffected by this. Even more oddly, this issue is solved by setting a CSS <code>opacity</code> of .9 or below on the parent of the fixed element.
- Combinations <code>position: fixed</code> and overflow properties are best avoided, as both have been known to cause unpredictable issues in older versions of Android OS.

"Validate with JQuery Mobile and Type=""Date"" and required","Error message for input with type=""date"" doesn't go away after a valid date is entered. 

To reproduce:
1. Create simple JQuery mobile form with 2 required fields and submit button.

```
<input id=""Title"" name=""Title"" placeholder="""" value="""" type=""text"" required=""required""  />
<input id=""Date"" name=""Date"" placeholder="""" type=""date"" required=""required"" />
<input type=""submit"" value=""Save Meal"" />
```

Partial JS

```
$(function () {
    // initialize validator and add a custom form submission logic
    $(""#myform"").validator({
        position: 'top left',
        offset: [-12, 0],

        message: '<div><em/></div>' // em element is the arrow
    }).submit(function (e) {

        var form = $(this);  .....
```

Leave fields blank and submit the form. Each field gets its error message. This is perfect. Now enter a date in the date field and leave the text field blank and resubmit the form. Both fields still show the error message. The error message for the date field should go away after a valid date is entered.

Fix the Uploader to make sure it only sends events once,"Currently the Uploader may try to upload new events to the Nikhef server and due to network problems not finish within 30 seconds, causing the upload to timeout. When a timeout occurs the Python script will try to upload the events again in the next batch. However in the background Windows might still be trying to upload the events, which may succeed, and because Python is no longer listening to the response it is unaware that it actually succeeded. This will cause duplicate events on the server.

Here are some possible solutions:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8037724/how-to-shutdown-a-timed-out-http-post-using-urlopen-by-urllib2-in-python

The preferred solution:
- Simply kill the upload process in case of a timeout, so that a timeout is indeed a timeout.
  If multiple timeouts occur the batch size may need to be changed dynamically.

Other solutions may include extra server side scripts:
- The server collects a list hashes of received event batches, the client can check that list to see which events were successfully sent.
- Use a more robust send-response mechanism

NFS mount failures on OSX,"On OSX, the way vagrant writes to /etc/exports is wrong for certain combinations of paths.

Suppose the following configuration:

  config.vm.share_folder ""foo"", ""/mymounts/foo"", ""/foo"", :nfs=>true
  config.vm.share_folder ""foobar"", ""/mymounts/bar"", ""/foo/bar"", :nfs=>true

This will produce a broken /etc/exports file (broken for OSX anyway) that looks like:

  ""/foo"" 192.168.42.3 -mapall=502:20
  ""/foo/bar"" 192.168.42.3 -mapall=502:20

This results in permission denied failures when the vagrant image tries to mount both nfs paths.  On OSX, subpaths must be combined on the same line as their root in the exports file.  Thus, /etc/exports needs to look like:

  ""/foo""  ""/foo/bar"" 192.168.42.3 -mapall=502:20

[Form] `required` attribute is set on all form fields regardless of whether they are required or not,"Build a form from a form type class:

```
public function buildForm( FormBuilder $builder, array $options )
{
    $builder
        ->add( 'text', 'text', array(
            'label' => 'search.form.text.label'
        ) )
        ->add( 'date', 'date', array(
            'widget' => 'single_text',
            'format' => 'dd.MM.yyyy',
            'label' => 'search.form.date.label'
        ) );
}
```

Add basic validation rules where none of the fields are required:

```
Me\MyBundle\Form\Model\TextSearch:
  properties:
    date:
      - Type: \DateTime
```

Render the form:

```
<form method=""post"" {{ form_enctype( form ) }}>
    {{ form_widget( form ) }}
    <input type=""submit"" value=""Search"" />
</form>
```

All the fields get a `required` attribute:

```
<label for=""text_search_text"" class="" required"">Text</label>
<input type=""text"" id=""text_search_text"" name=""text_search[text]"" required=""required"" value="""" />
```

This is incorrect, since the validation rules state that they are not required.

Under _Forms (2.0) – Form Validation_, the documentation states:

> **HTML5 Validation**  
> As of HTML5, many browsers can natively enforce certain validation constraints on the client side. The most common validation is activated by rendering a `required` attribute **on fields that are required**. […]  
> Generated forms take full advantage of this new feature **by adding sensible HTML attributes** that trigger the validation.

This is clearly not the case: all the fields get the `required` attribute.

Also, under _Built-in Field Types – Field Type Options_ (i.e. not under _Form Validation_), one can read:

> **The `required` option**  
> The most common option is the `required` option, which can be applied to any field. **By default, the `required` option is set to `true`**, meaning that HTML5-ready browsers will apply client-side validation if the field is left blank.

In other words, Symfony is artificially introducing a discrepancy between the client- and the server-side validation criteria, and this by default.

Moreover, there is a conflict between the two cited paragraphs of the documentation. The first one states that the `required` attribute is rendered on fields that are required, which is confirmed by the following paragraph under _Field Type Guessing – Field Type Options Guessing_:

> `required`: The required option can be guessed based off of the validation rules (i.e. is the field `NotBlank` or `NotNull`) or the Doctrine metadata (i.e. is the field `nullable`). This is very useful, as your client-side validation will automatically match your validation rules.

However, the second paragraph states that the `required` option is set to `true` by default.

**Resolution**
1. The documentation should be corrected for consistency: under _Built-in Field Types – Field Type Options_:
   
   > By default, the `required` option is set to `true` **on the fields that are guessed to be required based on the validation rules**, meaning that HTML5-ready browsers will apply client-side validation if the field is left blank.
2. Symfony’s behaviour should be changed to match the documentation: the `required` option should be set based on the guessed value and not to `true` by default.

Is it possible to detect an incorrect redirect?,"Posted this issue: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9530414/capybara-timing-issue

Capybara intelligently waits to keep the sequence of test commands in sync with the UI. However, I've got a false positive from the following:
1. Fill in value to input field
2. Click link that incorrectly redirects to same page, wiping out previous value
3. Test checks value of the field. Since the redirect has not come back yet, the old value is still there, recording a false positive.

I was wondering if there is a way correctly test this case, **ensuring that incorrect case is caught**. Not surprisingly, when the code is fixed to use an ajax call, the test passes.

A more direct way to do the test would be to assert that the page did not redirect after clicking the link.

Recommended way to handle various git branches needing different gemsets?,"Have been using rvm for a while and I'm a big fan. Taking over the default behavior of ""cd"" is a little scary and not the most intuitive at first, but overall, it's just great!

However, today I was working in a separate git branch and needing to switch back and forth between two git branches that used the same .rvmrc and realized that I was having to update the gemset because I had removed a few gems (and associated code) from one and not the other.

My first thought was that maybe an answer would be to have RVM store the gemset in the project directory and have git automatically switch back and forth between what the current gemset was automatically when you switch the branch- similar to the way it used to behave for me when I used to have plugins (and gems because we had it setup that way) in the vendor directory for the project. But keeping all of the gems in git for each project doesn't seem like a good solution.

So my second thought was maybe to have something in the .rvmrc that got the current git branch and put it into the name of the gemset. You'd still have to do bundle install after first going into the git branch of the project, but you'd only have to do it once.

What do you think of this, and would it be worth suggesting this perhaps as the default example of an .rvmrc? Or is there an even better way to handle it?

Thanks!
Gary

RestTemplate support for URL elements that can contain { } characters [SPR-9220],"**[Keith Donald](https://jira.spring.io/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=kdonald)** opened **[SPR-9220](https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-9220?redirect=false)** and commented

The following issue was observed when working with Apache Solr, which has a query function syntax of query parameter values declared within bracket {} delimiters. For example:

http://localhost:8983/solr/select?wt=json&indent=true&fl=**&q=**:*&fq={!geofilt}&sfield=venue_location&pt=28.0674,-80.5595&d=25.

Calling restTemplate.getForObject(String, Class\<T>) and manually escaping { and } with %7B and %7D doesn't work because the escaping gets applied twice. Leaving the { } characters as-is doesn't work as the parameter value is treated as a URI variable.

Present workaround seems to construct a URI instead of passing in a url String. Wanted to submit this issue for documentation and see if it's possible to add enhanced support for cases like this.

Spring JDBC: provide a simple utility API for loading parameterizable SQL strings from externalized Resources [SPR-9228],"**[Keith Donald](https://jira.spring.io/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=kdonald)** opened **[SPR-9228](https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-9228?redirect=false)** and commented

It's much easier to maintain non-trivial SQL like the example below(1) when it is externalized into a separate file. It wouldn't take much to provide basic support in Spring JDBC for loading SQL from externalized resources. I don't want to bring in another tool like MyBatis just for this. I rolled my own implementation based on some code from ResourceDatabasePopulator(2).

(1)

```
SELECT o.id as organization_id, o.name as organization_name, o.logo as organization_logo, u.username as organization_username,
       l.id as league_id, l.slug as league_slug, l.sport as league_sport, l.format as league_format, l.nature as league_nature,
       s.number as season_number, s.name as season_name, s.picture as season_picture, s.start_date as season_start_date,
       v.venue_id, v.venue_name, v.venue_latitude, v.venue_longitude
  FROM seasons s
    INNER JOIN leagues l ON s.league = l.id
    INNER JOIN organizations o ON l.organization = o.id
    INNER JOIN (SELECT l.league, l.venue as venue_id, v.name as venue_name, v.latitude as venue_latitude, v.longitude as venue_longitude
                  FROM league_venues l
                    INNER JOIN venues v ON l.venue = v.id
                  WHERE l.primary_venue = true) v ON l.id = v.league
    LEFT OUTER JOIN usernames u ON o.id = u.organization
  WHERE s.status = 'o'

Use of tabular data with cucumber-jvm for Clojure results in NullPointerException,"Looks like a bug in `cucumber.runtime.StepDefinitionMatch` where the [code that deals with tabular data](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-jvm/blob/master/core/src/main/java/cucumber/runtime/StepDefinitionMatch.java#L136) calls `getGenericListType(int)`, which in turn dereferences `StepDefinition#getParameterTypes()`.

Unfortunately, `cucumber.runtime.clojure.ClojureStepDefinition#getParameterTypes()` [always returns](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-jvm/blob/master/clojure/src/main/java/cucumber/runtime/clojure/ClojureStepDefinition.java#L44) `null`, thus resulting in the NPE.

AbstractToken serialization fails on php 5.4,"After upgrading to php 5.4, our site backend stopped working. After some digging through the code, the issue is related to an incorrect serialization of AbstractToken roles.

The exception:

```
PHP Fatal error:  Call to a member function getRole() on a non-object in /vendor/symfony/symfony/src/Symfony/Component/Security/Core/Role/RoleHierarchy.php on line 47
```

On PHP 5.3, serializing $this->roles

```
Array ( 
  [0] => Madalynn\Bundle\AndroBundle\Entity\Role Object (
    [id:protected] => 1
    [role:protected] => ROLE_ADMIN
    [description:protected] => The administrator role
    [created:protected] => DateTime Object (
      [date] => 2012-03-24 14:28:58
      [timezone_type] => 3
      [timezone] => UTC )
    [updated:protected] => DateTime Object (
      [date] => 2012-03-24 14:28:58
      [timezone_type] => 3
      [timezone] => UTC ) ) )
```

gives :

```
a:1:{i:0;O:39:""Madalynn\Bundle\AndroBundle\Entity\Role"":5:{s:5:""*id"";i:1;s:7:""*role"";s:10:""ROLE_ADMIN"";s:14:""*description"";s:22:""The administrator role"";s:10:""*created"";O:8:""DateTime"":3:{s:4:""date"";s:19:""2012-03-24 14:28:58"";s:13:""timezone_type"";i:3;s:8:""timezone"";s:3:""UTC"";}s:10:""*updated"";O:8:""DateTime"":3:{s:4:""date"";s:19:""2012-03-24 14:28:58"";s:13:""timezone_type"";i:3;s:8:""timezone"";s:3:""UTC"";}}}
```

On PHP 5.4, the same object serialize to

```
a:1:{i:0;r:13;}
```

As a result, $this->roles is unserialized to

```
array(1) {
  [0] => string(31) ""gyokoxjx08owkg0k4wcc08ckowwk04w""
}
```

Unfortunately, I wasn't able to fix the serialized issue, and a google search does not lead to a simple fix. Hopefully, some Synfony experts will be able to fix this!

MongoDB: support $elemMatch feature,"In MongoDB, if one wishes to apply multiple criteria to embedded documents within an array, one has to use the $elemMatch feature. See ""Matching with $elemMatch"" at http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Dot+Notation+%28Reaching+into+Objects%29.

It would be cool if QueryDSL was able to support this query notation.

A good example is given at the bottom of the page above:

```
// Document 1
{ ""foo"" : [
      {
        ""shape"" : ""square"",
        ""color"" : ""purple"",
        ""thick"" : false
      },
      {
        ""shape"" : ""circle"",
        ""color"" : ""red"",
        ""thick"" : true
      }
] }


// Document 2
{ ""foo"" : [
      {
        ""shape"" : ""square"",
        ""color"" : ""red"",
        ""thick"" : true

      {
        ""shape"" : ""circle"",
        ""color"" : ""purple"",
        ""thick"" : false
      }
] }
```

In order to query for a document containing a purple square, the mongodb query is:

`db.foo.find({foo: {""$elemMatch"": {shape: ""square"", color: ""purple""}}})`

"@ExclusionPolicy(""all"") is not respected by the parent classes","I'm using the agnostic storage pattern for a bundle and I have three User classes:

```
Vendor\Bundle\AuthenticationBundle\Model\User
|- Vendor\Bundle\AuthenticationBundle\Entity\User
  |- Project\AuthenticationBundle\Entity\User

When using the `@ExclusionPolicy(""all"")` on the `Project\AuthenticationBundle\Entity\User` one would expect all properties of the parents to be also excluded. However, this is not the case and requires me to add the same exclusion policy on each parent, otherwise all the parent properties are serialized. This is a problem because I don't want to create a dependency like this for the bundles.

The problem seems to lie in the way `AnnotationDriver` lists the class properties, since it doesn't take into account the parent class annotations, if set.

Is there a workaround for this?

I've accomplished a POC by adding bounds return value to _findSelectedObjects and firing an event inside __onMouseUp in canvas.class.js (229):

``` javascript
if (this._groupSelector) {
        // group selection was completed, determine its bounds

geom_hline: inherit.aes is always FALSE,"For `geom_hline`, `vline`, and `abline`, `inherit.aes` is always FALSE. I can see an advantage: when drawing data from a different data frame, it won't attempt to map possibly nonexistent variables to `x` and `y`. However, there are a few drawbacks:
- Behavior is inconsistent with other geoms.
- Aesthetics such as `colour` and `yintercept` can't be inherited and must be respecified for the geom. This is especially strange if the values are drawn from the original data frame.

``` R
mtcar_means <- ddply(mtcars, .(cyl), summarise, mpg = mean(mpg))
# cyl      mpg
#   4 26.66364
#   6 19.74286
#   8 15.10000

# All black lines
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x=disp, y=mpg, colour=factor(cyl))) + geom_point() +
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept=mpg), data=mtcar_means)

# Need to respecify mapping to get colored lines
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x=disp, y=mpg, colour=factor(cyl))) + geom_point() +
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept=mpg, colour=factor(cyl)), data=mtcar_means)
```

It appears impossible to set `inherit.aes=TRUE`. I think this is because the value is hard-coded in the `$new` functions for each geom. If it is indeed desired to have them _not_ inherit by default, I think a better way is to set the default value `inherit.aes=FALSE`, instead of hard-coding it.

``` R
# Can't set inherit.aes=TRUE
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x=disp, y=mpg, colour=factor(cyl))) + geom_point() +
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept=mpg), data=mtcar_means, inherit.aes=TRUE)
# Error in get(x, envir = this, inherits = inh)(this, ...) :
#   formal argument ""inherit.aes"" matched by multiple actual arguments

CORS support [SPR-9278],"**[Keith Donald](https://jira.spring.io/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=kdonald)** opened **[SPR-9278](https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-9278?redirect=false)** and commented

Cross origin resource sharing (CORS) is a relevant spec these days with the emergence of HTML5 & JS clients that consume data via REST APIs. For a given app, in many cases the host that serves the JS (e.g. foo.com) is different than the host that serves the data (e.g. api.foo.com). In this case, CORS can enable the cross-domain communication.

It would be useful if Spring MVC provided code & guidance on how to configure CORS when implementing a Java-backed REST API consumed by JS clients located in other domains. Prior work exists that would be a candidate for integration.

See the resources below:
CORS Spec: http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/
Basic example of a CorsFilter implementation: https://gist.github.com/2232095
What appears to be a full-featured CorsFilter implementation: https://bitbucket.org/jsumners/corsfilter

We have a Jenkins project that runs both our PHPUnit and Behat tests. Both produce JUnit-style XML files with status about the tests.

Failing on some multiple URLs,"## Overview

I am trying to create a very basic scraper with PhantomJS and pjscrape framework.
## My Code

```
pjs.config({
timeoutInterval: 6000,
timeoutLimit: 10000,
format: 'csv', 
csvFields: ['productTitle','price'],
writer: 'file', 
outFile: 'D:\\prod_details.csv'
});

pjs.addSuite({
title: 'ChainReactionCycles Scraper',
url: productURLs, //This is an array of URLs, two example are defined below 
scrapers: [
function() {
    var results [];
    var linkTitle = _pjs.getText('#ModelsDisplayStyle4_LblTitle');
    var linkPrice = _pjs.getText('#ModelsDisplayStyle4_LblMinPrice');
    results.push([linkTitle[0],linkPrice[0]]); 
    return results;
}
]
});
```
## URL Array's Used

This first array DOES NOT WORK and fails after the 3rd or 4th URL.

```
var productURLs = [""8649"",""17374"",""7327"",""7325"",""14892"",""8650"",""8651"",""14893"",""18090"",""51318""];
for(var i=0;i<productURLs.length;++i){
  productURLs[i] = 'http://www.chainreactioncycles.com/Models.aspx?ModelID=' + productURLs[i];
}
```

This second array WORKS and does not fail, even though it is from the same site.

```
var categoriesURLs = [""304"",""2420"",""965"",""518"",""514"",""1667"",""521"",""1302"",""1138"",""510""];
for(var i=0;i<categoriesURLs.length;++i){
categoriesURLs[i] = 'http://www.chainreactioncycles.com/Categories.aspx?CategoryID=' + categoriesURLs[i];
}
```
## Problem

When iterating through productURLs the PhantomJS page.open optional callback automatically assumes failure. Even when the page hasn't finished loading.

I know this as I started the script up while running an HTTP debugger and the HTTP request were still running even after PhantomJS had reported a a page load failure.

However, the code works fine when running with categoriesURLs.
## Assumptions
1. All the URL's listed above are VALID
2. I have the latest versions of both PhantomJS and pjscrape
## Possible Solutions

These are solutions I have tried thus far.
1. Disabling image loading page.options.loadImages = false
2. Settings a larger timeoutInterval in pjs.config this was not useful apparently as the error generated was of a page.open failure and NOT a timeout failure.

Any ideas?

Reverse Verticle Scrolling z-index bug,"I am running into a little issue, using the reverse scrolling feature of the jCarousel plugin.

I am able to get the Vertical reverse scrolling functionality working using this fix http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2819464/how-to-make-jcarousel-vertical-scroller-reverse-scroll. 

Not the best solution, editing the source code, I know. I tired setting the rtl option to true but it doesn't seem to effect the direction of the vertical layout. So if anyone knows of a better way to have the Vertical Carousel reverse direction please let me know.

However my issue happens because of the negative jcarouselindex that the plugin gives.

I noticed that when using the rtl option on the horizontal orientation the indexes are incremented not decremented even though the carousel is in reverse.

I was wondering if anyone could tell me how I could achieve the same effect, but for the vertical layout, where the carousel is navigating backwards but still incrementing the indexes not decrementing?

Thank you for all your help, this is simply an amazing library, great job to all those to gave this to the dev community.

Handle OSX CMD modifier key-events,"Extjs supports CMD for selection, but not as a modifier key for `Ext.util.KeyMap`. This makes it hard to handle `CMD-a`. As you can read here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3902635/how-does-one-capture-a-macs-command-key-via-javascript, we may use browser specific solutions. 

E.g: When a user is trying to press `CMD-a`, we would:
- First catch the CMD `keydown` event as a browser specific `event.keyCode`.
- Then wait for the user to press the `a`-key, or the user releases the CMD key.

This is not to hard to do, however it does require a custom subclass of `Ext.util.KeyMap`. We can easily add `keyup` events in the public `enable` and `disable` methods. However, the methods that handles events, `handleKeyDown`, `processBinding` and `checkModifiers`, are all private methods which may change without notice (since they are not designed to be overridden).

A mostly safe solution would be to:
- extend `checkModifiers` to handle `CMD` as `CTRL`.
- extend `enable` and `disable` with a custom keyup and keydown handler.
- extend the `constructor` to no allow a custom `eventName`.

Map shown is off by few miles,"Hi, first of all thanks for this wonderful gem. It does make a developer's life easier.

I'm trying to use the gem in my application and it is working fine in terms of maps displayed etc. However, the marker shown on the map is off by few miles than that shown on maps.google.com.

For example, I have these fields in my app -
- venue: Ravindra Kalakshethra
- street: Jayachamaraja Wodeyar Rd
- city: Bangalore

The coordinates that I get for this address is _12.9551537_, _77.58009899999999_, which is off by few miles from actual location. If I search for **Ravindra Kalakshethra, Jayachamaraja Wodeyar Rd, Bangalore** on Google Maps, it shows the location perfectly.

Any idea why is this happening?

This is how my model looks like -

``` ruby
class Event
  include Gmaps4rails::ActsAsGmappable
  include Mongoid::Document

  field :street, :type => String

Game Load Time is extremely long and Textures invisible,"Hi guys,
i am facing two problems with MonoGame for Android when deploying on a real device.

Development Device/Informations:
- Visual Studio 2010, Monogame 2.5.0.0, Xamarin MonoDroid
- The developement device i am using is a Samsung Galaxy W SGH-T679M (OS 2.3)
- According to the informations i found on the web, the GPU is => Qualcomm Adreno (TM) 205 / OpenGL ES-CM 1.1
- I develop on this device to have as much compatibility as possible with the different devices (old & new)

When porting a Windows Phone XNA game to Android using MonoDroid/MonoGame, the game is working fine, load quickly and everything works well in the emulator.

However, when deploying on a real device i am facing these two problems:

1) Load Time:
- The load time to launch my game vary between 90sec to 120sec. Even when removing any Assets Loading code, the game still take that long to launch.
- I tried the CatapultWars Demo, it take really long to load but the game itself work flawlessly.
- I tried to create an empty OpenGL project with MonoDroid and keep the spinning square demo and it is loading in ~2-3sec. and run really smooth.

2) Textures invisible
- Beside the load time problem, my textures are not visible on a real device, even tho everything works fine in the Emulator(OS 2.2). All i can see is the GraphicsDevice.Clear color.
- I am using PNG, non power of 2(work in the emulator anyway). Even when using Power of 2 textures i have no success.

Thanks in advance!

bug in _sorteddict.KeysView,"Example:

```
import blist
d = blist.sorteddict((1,1),(2,2))
e = blist.sorteddict((1,1),(3,3))
d.keys() & e.keys()
```

fails with `AttributeError`. The culprit is the following method in `_sorteddict.KeysView`:

```
def _from_iterable(cls, it):
    return sortedset(key=self._mapping._sortedkeys.key)
```

First, this method is probably meant to be `@classmethod`. Second, the call to `sortedset` needs `it` as the first argument. Third, `_mapping` is only available from an instance, which we don't have here.

After the (trivial) fix to address the first two issues, the code I showed above works fine.

However, if `sorteddict` instance uses a custom sort key, it is lost. I don't know how to fix this. Possibly it shouldn't be fixed; what sort key should be used if the two sorteddict have different sort keys? Using the one from the LHS is quite arbitrary, even if we could retrieve it. I really don't know what the right approach is here.

trying to post a byte array or memory stream with RestSharp.

I have tried the following

request.AddFile(""stream"", x => new MemoryStream(blocks.First().Value), ""stream"", ""application/binary"");
And

request.AddFile(""stream"", blocks.First().Value, ""stream"", ""application/binary"");

The following program doesn't terminate, and I'm not sure why.

```
(ns test_twitter.core
  (:use [twitter.api.search]))

(defn -main []
  (println (search :params {:q ""@andrew_jones""}))
  (println ""HERE""))
```

It does print the results that I'd expect, and I see ""HERE"", but control isn't returned to the shell. I have to Ctrl-C to terminate the program. If I remove the line with (search :params ...) in it everything is fine.

I'm using Leiningen to build and run the example. I'm using twitter-api 0.6.4 and Clojure 1.3.0.

Bootstrap is not getting to its full potentiall...,"Well, every author knows about she's baby that it is not perfect... But please let me identify few (high level) issues with current approach in Bootstrap, which could be quite easily fixed.
1. HTML is for semantic elements, and CSS is for visual formatting. It is well known for everyone... But when I was looking for best CSS framework over there, I found following answer on Stackoverflow:
   http://stackoverflow.com/questions/203069/what-is-the-best-css-framework-and-are-they-worth-the-effort

Accepted answer has a good merits, so I was starting thinking how to solve it cleanly...

My conclusion was that using Less preprocessor it is quite easy. It's enough to have a whole framework as mixins and it is possible to make your own *.less, which will just import visual elements from bootstrap. Then no visual elements need to migrate into HTML.

E.g.
## my.html

<div class=""menu""></div>
## my.less

.menu {
  .nav;
  .nav-pills;
  .nav-stackable;
}

instead of writing in HTML:
<div class=""nav nav-pills nav-stackable""></div>

Above solution partially works. But only partially. Currently problem is that Bootstrap is not defined properly to mix classes into user LESS files. In above example there is e.g. error importing .nav-stackable. It is because .nav-stackable is not defined in ""nested way"" but traditionally:

// Stacked tabs and pills
.nav-stacked > li {
  float: none;
}
.nav-stacked > li > a {
  margin-right: 0; // no need for the gap between nav items
}

Because of that you can not mixin this class into your own *.less stylesheet (there is no simple .nav-stackable class - just descendants).

If it works it will be possible to completely get rid of visual elements from HTML, as you can always use your own having semantic meaning in your *.less file. There will be still problems with other selectors basing on .nav-stackable (which will be effectively renamed after mixin into client code), but I think it is a way to go nevertheless. Changing even part of Bootstrap can much improve situation.
1. It is another positive consequence of point 1. 

Currently I am trying to create Joomla template using Bootstrap. Unfortunately it is not possible to get it right. The problem is that Joomla uses it's own tags in HTML, which are expanded into other HTML. 

E.g.
<jdoc:include type=""modules"" name=""menu"" />

is expanded into:
<ul class=""menu"">
<li class=""item-101 current active""><a href=""#"" >Home</a></li>
<li class=""item-102""><a href=""#"" >test 1</a></li>
</ul>

and now I can not apply nav styles to ul list! It is generated by Joomla and I can not change it.

With Bootstrap defined as mixins it would be possible to make it in own *.less file as presented above:

.menu {
  .nav;
  .nav-pills;
  .nav-stackable;
}

After these changes code in less files and in user HTML should be much cleaner and just better.

Fix product version system,"Historical product information should always be available via the SilverStripe Versioned system. This means product prices, titles etc will all be available...and can even be accessed from deleted products.

The system has been failing however, as Versioned.php has a bug, where if a version is not available, it outputs a debug message, breaking sites sometimes completely.

The error most people will receive is, for example:

```

Confusion around binding request parameters to Maps using Spring MVC [SPR-9265],"**[Keith Donald](https://jira.spring.io/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=kdonald)** opened **[SPR-9265](https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-9265?redirect=false)** and commented

I'm trying to access HTTP query parameters as a java.util.Map Controller method argument.

This doesn't work but doesn't fail (the map appears to be always empty):

```
@RequestMapping(value=""/{organization}/{league}/{season}/teams"", method=RequestMethod.POST, produces=""application/json"")
public ResponseEntity<? extends Object> registerTeam(Map<String, Object> team) { ... }
```

This works (I have access to request query params) but doesn't appear to be documented (in either the ref manual or `@RequestParam` JavaDoc):

```
@RequestMapping(value=""/{organization}/{league}/{season}/teams"", method=RequestMethod.POST, produces=""application/json"")
public ResponseEntity<? extends Object> registerTeam(@RequestParam Map<String, Object> team) { ... }
```

It'd be good to document what is supported with parameter to map binding, and what is happening when no `@RequestParam` annotation is used on a Map method argument.

I've added this gem as a devise strategy, and have a model named Document, after signing in any calls to an action from the  document controller uses the REXML::Document to evaluate against instead of my apps Document class.

What would be the best way to work around this issue?

Thanks!

list_pagination_links leads to stack too deep error in production,"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9851763/activescaffold-gives-stack-too-deep-error-can-not-find-any-recursion

It appears that something in my data causes this call to render to do something bad.  Does it go into a recursion itself, I'm not sure.  I know that if I replace list_pagination_links with the content ""FOO"", that it _still_ fails... it's the act of getting to it that is causing stack too deep.  If I comment out this render, I get a result.

This is with my infinite pagination patch, but not for a page that would have infinite pagination enabled.

Improper use of for..in,"Hi,

I was porting an existing Javascript program to Windows 8 (Metro). I came across an issue that I wanted to bring to your notice. 

The localStorageDB code has a few places where a for.. in loop is used to iterate through arrays. The issues I was facing were fixed when I changed these to a regular for loop. I thought I could bring this to your notice so you could fix it in the code. The for..in loop is meant to loop through properties of an object.
http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_loop_for_in.asp

Here are some references with explanations on why it shouldn't be used to loop through arrays:
http://blog.sebarmeli.com/2010/12/06/best-way-to-loop-through-an-array-in-javascript/

This causes confusion when setting a header such as ""Content-Type"", but accidentally/unknowingly setting it as ""Content-type"". The header is forgotten in the overwrite.

This pull request fixes this issue, although it still leaves a minor hole for errors. It might be an idea to either use an Array interface for the headers or set them to private and use __get, __set for retrieving them in a case-insensitive manner.

Option for jsonify handles dates by converting to isoformat,"When `jsonify` is called on an object with a 'date' it throws:

```

There is an innocuous fix - see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/455580

```
def date_handler(obj):

        return obj.isoformat()

And https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask/blob/master/flask/helpers.py#L142 becomes:

```
json_str = json.dumps(dict(*args, **kwargs), indent=None, default=date_handler)
```

This strikes me as preferable to TypeError.

Alternatively, `jsonify` could accept a `default` argument that is passed to `json.dumps`.

Need to check time is a valid time,"I am splitting date and time into separate fields in my model and need to validate them separately.

As part of the validation I need to allow nil/blank start_time but if there is something then I need to make sure it is a valid time.

I tried: 

```
validates :start_time, :allow_nil => true, :date => { :after_or_equal_to => Proc.new { Time.now.beginning_of_day }, :before_or_equal_to => Proc.new { Time.now.end_of_day } }
```

and I suspect it is because I think ruby just defaults a date onto the front of times, (eg 2000-01-01 or something) which means that the start_time will never be between [in effect] today at midnight 00:00 and tonight at midnight 23:59 because it is using a date value from 12 years ago.

Can you offer any guidance how I can validate that a time is a time but doesn't matter when during the day?

I need it to fail if someone manages to send ""random string"" to my model.

Thanks

Btw I'm just converting over from using validates_timeliness and have found your gem to be far more straight forward to apply....up until this issue with validating a time

Support for LinkedIn Field-Selector Notation,"Trying to make calls like [1]:

```
                    request = new RestRequest(""v1/people/~{fields}"", Method.GET);
                    request.AddParameter(""fields"", "":(id,first-name,last-name,industry)"", ParameterType.UrlSegment);
                    request.AddParameter(""format"", ""json"");
```

Or

request = new RestRequest(""v1/people/~:(id,first-name,last-name,industry)"", Method.GET);

But have no trouble accessing:

request = new RestRequest(""v1/people/~"", Method.GET);

Which leads to me to believe that the 401 is not on the LinkedIn side but on how the request is formatted.

Too many recursions for preg_match_all in parseGeometryCollection,"hi,

i just came across a problem, that preg_match_all in parseGeometryCollection will die when re-saving a larger WKT with bout 1000 points.

lowering the pcre.recursion_limit as for example documented in http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7620910/regexp-in-preg-match-function-returning-browser-error will avoid such behavior but strip the contents from the WKT field.

as a side-note, i have some cycling tracks from garmin which i export using google earth to KML export and try to import them into drupal 7 using geocoder + geofield. the import/geocoding part works, but when re-saving the drupal node that contains the WKT data, the problem stated above causes PHP to die.

Open Declaration via the context menu now works as expected.,"When the user right clicks on a element and select ""Open Declaration"" in the
context menu, an instance of `OpenAction` is used to resolve the binding and
jump to the declaration.

Because the Eclipse API does not expose an extension point for this action, I
had to create a custom extension point (using AJDT), which allows weaving in to
JDT and can be used to intercept the creation of `OpenAction`, if it
originates from a Scala editor.

This seem to be the only solution, which does not involve creating our own
Scala Editor. Hopefully, we will be able to remove this custom extension point
once we implement the Scala Editor (this is planned for Milestone 2 of the
Scala IDE Helium).  Using AJDT for customizing the behavior of `OpenAction`
was also suggested by Andrew Eisenberg in the following StackOverflow question:

        return (document.cookie = [

            options.secure  ? '; secure' : ''
        ].join(''));
```

it alerts the correct subdomain (without a leading dot (.) ) - so not sure why this is happening..

The code I use to set the cookie:

$.cookie('from', 'test', { expires: 7, path: '/', domain: ""subdomain.site.com"" });

Could not find uniform_notifier-1.0.2 in any of the sources`

So i suspect the problem is likely with uniform_notifier but as i said, trying to install this gem prior to bullet hasn't helped.

Have you got any suggestions please?

EDIT: I've just added bullet to a new Rails 3.2 gemfile and run `bundle install` and i'm having the same problem there too.

Import pycassa.types & import datetime issue,"I'm seeing a problem in Python v2.7.1 with pycassa v1.5.1 where the order of imports is causing an AttributeError:

If the imports are in the following order:

```

There we see an error:

HUD not changing label second time,"I'm using MBProgressHUD in our teaching App, which is tab bar navigated.

It is using the showWhileExecuting statement.

It goes through three while statements to change from ""Connecting"" to ""Downloading"" to ""Unpacking"".
All perfectly right.

Here comes the problem...
The second time I do this the label text will not change.  It is stuck on ""Connecting"".
I can see in the NSLog that it is going through the other loops.  If I try to change the Mode, the app crashes.  But only the second time, and any subsequent uses.  If I kill the App everything works again for the first time.

redirect_to possible bug with hash (#),"redirect_to seems to add hash parameters of the referrer url.

To reproduce, say you have a model User
1. post a form to /users/create#my_hash
2. make the create action redirect_to ""/users/1"" - or any string (can use a url helper as well, this is just for clarity of the example)

Even though the redirect_to does not include #my_hash it will redirect to /users/1#my_hash
I've looked through the source of Rails but can't find the culprit, perhaps it might have to do with Rack?

I think the behavior is not the expected behavior.
Note: If you redirect_to ""/users/1#"" then the redirect will be proper (to ""/users/1#"" and not ""/users/1#my_hash"").

Load workers w/o the rails environment,"I see in the wiki that it's possible to start up workers without loading the rails environment, but I'm having some trouble doing that. 

I am indeed working within a rails app, but don't need the environment loaded to process jobs, as they are unrelated to the web app.

I have a rake file ""resque.rake"" in lib/tasks, and all I have in there is `require ""resque/tasks""`. When running the rake task, I get

```
rake aborted!

Okay, so perhaps it's trying to load the application controller? I'm fairly new to rails, so I apologize if this is something obvious! I assume I have to add some additional filepaths to $LOAD_PATHS? Specifically I need to load in the worker files, but that's not the problem at the moment.

Delay in sync causes issues when moving playlists,"This question is related to http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9464280/moving-playlist-to-folder-doesnt-work. When moving a number of playlists (identified by a prefix in their names), it seems like it sometimes uses the wrong indexes and moves some (or all) other playlists to the folder instead.

This code is executed (in a `for-in`) for all playlists matching the name pattern:

```
// find out which index to use
NSUInteger playlistIndex = [[[[SPSession sharedSession] userPlaylists] playlists] indexOfObject: playlist];

// move the playlist to the target folder
BOOL success = [[[SPSession sharedSession] userPlaylists] movePlaylistOrFolderAtIndex: playlistIndex ofParent: nil toIndex: 0 ofNewParent: targetFolder error: &error];

if (success) {
    // rename playlist
    DLog(@""Success! Playlist moved to folder %@ (error: %@)."", targetFolder.name, error);
    playlistMoved = YES;
} 
else {
    DLog(@""Failed to move playlist %@ with error: %@"", playlist.name, error);
}
```

The problem is that in some occasions, it's not moving the right playlists. It looks like it either gets the wrong `playlistIndex` or that the index calculation being done in `-(BOOL)movePlaylistOrFolderAtIndex:ofParent:toIndex:ofNewParent:error` doesn't work properly.

Could this be an issue with how the sync (to the Spotify server) works in `cocoalibspotify` or is there something wrong with the index calc?

touch events not firing in subviews,"Hi,

I've come across a potential bug for iOs devices. Android seems to work as expected.

This [jsfiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/p9KMt/9/) sets up two divs, one a subview of another.When you click on the light pink one you get 'foo', when you click on the dark pink div you get 'bar. This is expected.

Now look at this [jsfiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/p9KMt/10/). Same setup except the outer div (parent) is not set up to listen for touchstart events. I would expect that touching on the outer div to do nothing (this works as expected) and touching the inner div to alert 'bar'. However if you tap the inner div **nothing** happens!

For comparison here is a purely jquery version. [Example 1](http://jsfiddle.net/p9KMt/12/) and [Example 2](http://jsfiddle.net/p9KMt/13/). These work as expected.

2.0.x,"Minor exception message change to make it easier to troubleshoot GSP compilation issues.  I have run into this a lot when migrating applications from 1.3.x to 2.0.x, which is now more strict regarding the format of GSP tags and their attributes.  By adding the name and value of the tag that has failed the validation to the exception message, it makes it much easier to find the offending GSP, especially when dealing with layouts and templates that render other templates, etc (can become a rabbit hole of GSP's to follow).

Also added a few additional exclusions that we may want in place for the Maven plugin if we decide to use my Grails Dependency POM generator project to generate the POM file containing the core Grails JAR's and required third-party JARs.

If I track that up a level, the error is really:
`>>> wcs = wcs_util.WCS(header, dimensions=dimensions, slices=slices)
*** TypeError: header must be a string or an astropy.io.fits.Header object`

This is because, if astropy is installed, ""import pywcs"" grabs this pywcs:
astropy-0.0.dev1006-py2.6-macosx-10.6-i386.egg/pywcs/**init**.py
instead of the non-astropy version.

This may be an astropy bug, not an aplpy one, but I figure a workaround should be put in place for aplpy too.  As it stands, I don't know how to work around the issue (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9197668/python-two-packages-with-the-same-name-how-do-you-specify-which-is-loaded) but I think astropy's pywcs should not be doing an isinstance check.

Cannot compile the library,"Hi,

I cannot compile the library with Ant. I included the error below. 

The first error message I got is ""package com.sun.xml.internal.bind.marshaller does not exist"". I'm using JDK 1.6.20.

I'm not sure if I can use the library even if I can compile. I host my application using Google Application Engine which may not allow JAXB classes to work. 

Thanks

Goksel

checkbox border in IE,"bootstrap.css applies border property to input type=checkbox element, which forces them to render inconsistently in IE 7/8/9 (now they look old-style like in Windows 98). As long as there's no way to reset that property to default behavior, I'd suggest something like:

ORIGINAL:

<pre>
input {
    border:1px solid #000;
    border-radius:3px;
}
</pre>


PROPOSED:

<pre>
input[type=""text""], input[type=""password""], input[type=""button""], ..., ..., ... {
    border:1px solid #000;
    border-radius:3px;
}
</pre>


the only properties that trigger old-style rendering are ""border"" and ""border-radius"".

In original bootstrap.css v.2.0.2 line numbers are:
917, 945

this scheme will leave checkboxes intact, still keeping compatibility with IE7+

A breakpoint in drawRect does reveal that the call is being made on two different threads.

Here's the current drawRect that I'm working with:

-(void)drawRect:(CGRect)rect {
    CGRect bounds = self.bounds;

```
//    NSLog(@""drawRect: {{%f,%f},{%f,%f}}"", rect.origin.x, rect.origin.y, rect.size.width, rect.size.height);

short zoom = log2(bounds.size.width / rect.size.width);
int x = floor(rect.origin.x / rect.size.width), y = floor(fabs(rect.origin.y / rect.size.height));
NSLog(@""Tile @ x:%d, y:%d, zoom:%d"", x, y, zoom);

NSAutoreleasePool *pool = [[NSAutoreleasePool alloc] init];

UIImage *tileImage = [[mapView tileSource] imageForTile:RMTileMake(x, y, zoom) inCache:[mapView tileCache]];
[tileImage drawInRect:rect];

[pool release]; pool = nil;
```

}

Any thoughts?  This would definately slow down my app because the processing of the images takes a little time.

Thanks!

loaded classes will not be cached by an opcode cache because of autoload,"`autoload` makes development more friendly since there is no need to explicitly include each class file. The downside of using `autoload` is that the loaded classes will not be cached by an opcode cache (if installed). Since Slim follows the front controller pattern, it is costly to load all the Slim classes on every page request. So maybe `Slim::autoload` should be replaced by some other mechanisms to `require` all the Slim classes at once?

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/546447/acegi-authentication-available-in-tomcat-404-error-handler

Here is my use case:
1) I have an application that contains few authenticated pages under /home/*. I am showing Welcome message for logged in users on all page if user is already logged in. To fetch logged in user's information I am using <security:authentication property=""principal.firstName"" />
2) I have setup in my web.xml to handle 404 error codes like:
    <error-page>
        <error-code>404</error-code>
        <location>/pagenotfound.html</location>
    </error-page>
3) When I am trying to access a page that is not available in my application I am correctly getting redirect to /pagenotfound.html but, the user information is lost (i.e. <security:authentication property=""principal.firstName"" />). Now if I access any valid page I can am able to get the user information back.

So the issue is with 404 redirect, somewhere during redirect user's information is getting removed from context and is unavailbale for <security:authentication /> taglib.

Claims/Permissions Based Auth,"Just reading the docs i get the impression this is role based only? 

I'm looking at more claims based auth, where each action has a claim or permission, 
those permissions are then mapped to the user in whatever way, e.g. by using groups.

When a resource is being accessed, the resource can ask whether the accessor has that 
permission/claim.

So an impl could be User.Group.HasPermission(Permission p) etc..

Is that possible with FS?

P.S Perhaps i should have asked in a mailing list or something?

partial views with options from session lead to JSON.stringify error (circular reference),"Some steps to reproduce (in Express v2.5.8)

1) Create a new project with session support (what I did)
2) Add a route that saves something to req.session (Memory)
3) pass that value to res.render () to a view that contains a partial for the type saved in the session. In my example:

some code:

app.js

```
app.get('/', function (req, res) {
    req.session.user = {username:'dan', password:'ASDF'};
    res.render('index', { title: 'Express' });
});

app.get('/test', function (req, res) {
    res.render(""test.jade"", {title:'test', user:req.session.user});
});
```

test.jade

```
p User details:
!= partial('user', user)
```

_user.partial

```
p User Partial : #{user.username}, - #{user.password}
```

Initially, I got the following when trying to render the view, test.jade: 

```
node.js:201
        throw e; // process.nextTick error, or 'error' event on first tick
          ^
TypeError: Converting circular structure to JSON
    at Object.stringify (native)
    at Array.0 (/home/dan/development/aqp/node_modules/express/node_modules/connect/lib/middleware/session    /memory.js:77:31)
    at EventEmitter._tickCallback (node.js:192:40)
```

after some digging, I found that I narrowed this down to renderPartial() in express/lib/view.js.

The problem, as I understand it, is that because parentLocals (in this case the session?) appears to be utils.union()'ed with the partial's object, user, causing a circular reference.

I am willing to admit that I am pretty new to node.js in general, so I could really just be using the tools wrong.

Twig syntax error trying to use FormServiceProvider,"Hello,

I got a Twig syntax error :  The filter ""trans"" does not exist in ""form_div_layout.html.twig"" at line 19
I know that is something to do with Translation but I don't use it, I know that when I register Translation provider I just have an error that tells me that 'translator.messages' is not defined, but I don't need at all translation for my project.

Do I have to override the default form_div_layout.html.twig and remove translations filters ? Or write somewhere in the application that I don't need translation ? how ?

I'm using FormServiceProvider because I want to use ValidatorServiceProvider to validate my form, I know that I can use the Validator without the FormServiceProvider, but I want to do it like it is written in Silex documentation : ""It is most useful when used with the FormServiceProvider""

Multiple Calls to viewWillAppear viewDidAppear...  iOS5.1,"Is anyone aware of an issue with iOS5.1 (possibly 5.0) and the viewController logic of MyLauncher which results in multiple calls to viewWillAppear and viewDidAppear etc?  

This problem is of course causing issues with my code!

(open launcher item1 and close it)

I found the following question on StackOverFlow: 
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7830830/ios-different-addsubview-behavior-between-ios-4-3-and-5-0

I think we need to update MyLauncher to account for this change in the way viewWill & Did appear with ChildViewControllers in iOS5 vs. iOS4!

Creating a camera shows warnings," I'm using SimpleCV 1.2 with Ubuntu 12.04. Creating a camera without an argument results in a number of warnings:

```
>>> from SimpleCV import *
>>> cam = Camera()
VIDIOC_QUERYMENU: Invalid argument
VIDIOC_QUERYMENU: Invalid argument
VIDIOC_QUERYMENU: Invalid argument
>>> 
```

I would have expected this to be handled transparently (just give me the first camera you can find), unless I specify an argument (e.g. 0 or 1 for first or second camera). The same warnings show when I pass 0 as an argument, however.

On a side note, if you pass OpenCV's cv.CaptureFromCAM the argument -1, it [should](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4835146/capturing-webcam-stream-in-python-using-opencv-need-help/5265337#5265337) grab whatever camera it can get. I think SimpleCV instead passes OpenCV index 0 by default.

"SSMS Addin installer not quite working for updated 2012, need manual file copy","Hi there, 

I installed version 1.3.1 of the ssms addin, when i start ssms i dont see any formatting options. This seems to be related to the locatin of the .addin file. when i move the addin does work

The default location is:
C:\Users\Public\Documents\microsoft\MSEnvShared\AddIns

When i use:
C:\Users\joost\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\MSEnvShared\Addins
it works

I did a quick check with process monitor, and it seems ssms doesnt even look for C:\Users\Public\Documents\microsoft\MSEnvShared\AddIns, even though it seems to be a standard location for addins. Not sure if this is a problem on my machine only since i dont have any other machines with 2012 installed yet. But i just wanted to let you know

---

UPDATE (TaoK): This issue seems to be caused by the recent microsoft updates; the first boot of SSMS 2012 after the updates seems to change the Add-in folder search path specification (""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\SQL Server Management Studio\11.0_Config\AutomationOptions\LookInFolders""), and always force it to a set of values that don't include the path the current SSMS Add-In setup package uses.

To work around this for the moment, manually move the Addin file from ""C:\Users\Public\Documents\microsoft\MSEnvShared\AddIns"" to ""C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\SQL Server Management Studio\11.0\Addins\"" (you may have to create this folder if you haven't already installed an add-in that uses it).

For XP, move from ""C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Documents\Microsoft\MSEnvShared\Addins"" to ""C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Microsoft\SQL Server Management Studio\11.0\Addins\"".

This issue should be fixed in the installer within a few days.

changing trigger events on existing tooltip ,"Hi there. I have a help tooltip that I want to be able to control how it is opened. I would like default to be click and mouseover, once it has been opened once I would like it to be only click unless someone makes a mistake, then I would like it to go back to click and mouseover . 

The initial set-up is easy thanks to the event system (def: ""mouseenter click, mouse leave""). I have even managed to unbind the mouseenter event with this:

```
$(""#help-button"").data(""tooltip"").getTrigger().unbind('mouseenter');
```

The issue is I can't rebind mouse enter the same way.. I tried 

```
$(""#help-button"").data(""tooltip"").getTrigger().bind('mouseenter');
```

but this does nothing.

Could someone help me with binding a trigger event to a tooltip that has already been established?

Cheers,

Pickled TrialHandler Backwards Compatibility,"Hi all,

When Jon updated TrialHandler to inherit from _BaseTrialHandler (somewhere around 34a14ad154, end of January) it broke the unpickling/loading, which was then fixed by Rebecca Sharman in 5b7efa7f54. 

However, that fix isn't backward compatible, so any TrialHandlers that were pickled with the older version (I think 1.73.02) can only be unpickled by that version and earlier. Here's the failing output when trying to unpickle files made with the earlier version using current versions (1.73.05, HEAD):

TypeError: ('object.**new**(X): X is not a type object (classobj)', <function _reconstructor at 0x1ef870>, (<class psychopy.data.TrialHandler at 0x6780308>, <type 'object'>, None))

Rebecca's fix was to remove object inheritance from _BaseTrialHandler in data.py: 

-class _BaseTrialHandler(object):
+class _BaseTrialHandler:

I don't understand python's inheritance well enough to know what's going when. My guess is that the pickled TrialHandler wasn't saved inheriting from anything, and doesn't think it needs to inherit from anything, but the newer version of TrialHandler thinks it should and is failing when it's not given a _BaseTrialHandler. But that's completely a guess.

In any case, we should be able to load older saved data using newer versions, especially since this was just a patch release. Can someone explain what's going on? And give me guidance on fixing it? I thought about using a try: except TypeError, but I don't know how to fix it without re-writing the method definition above.

Issue with nested FindAlls and SqlCompact40,"As originally described in http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9503809/simple-data-many-to-many-issues, the following code works well when there is only one record in the first FindAll, but fails with the following exception when there is more than one record:

Index was out of range. Must be non-negative and less than the size of the collection.

I'm using Simple.Data.Core, .Ado, and .SqlCompact40 1.0.0beta3

Here is all of the code for the class:

``` cs
public class ContractorRepository : IContractorRepository {
    dynamic _db;
    public TradeAllyRepository() {
        string dbPath = AppDomain.CurrentDomain.GetData(""DataDirectory"").ToString() + ""\\Contractors.sdf"";
        _db = Simple.Data.Database.Opener.OpenFile(dbPath);
    }

    public dynamic GetAllForZip(int zip) {
        var contractors = _db.Contractors
            .FindAll(_db.Contractors.CoverageZips.Zip == zip)
            .ToList();

        foreach (var contractor in contractors) {
            // Exception occurs here after working successfully for first iteration
            contractor.Types = GetTypesForContractor((int)contractor.Id);
        }

        return contractors;
    }

    public dynamic GetTypesForContractor(int id) {
        return _db.ContractorTypes
            .FindAll(_db.ContractorTypes.TypesForContractor.ContractorId == id)
            .ToList();
    }
}
```

I watched it with the debugger and looking at Dynamic view for `contractor` in the `foreach` it displays fine the first time and on the second time it displays: 

```
base {System.ArgumentException} = {""Index was out of range. Must be non-negative and less than the size of the collection.\r\nParameter name: index""}
```

If I had to guess (and this is based on a pretty basic understanding of this excellent library), the query isn't being executed until it is needed (which is good), but the second `FindAll` (in `GetTypesForContractor`) is crossing paths with the first and on the second iteration of the `foreach` the query has been lost. Is there a way for me to tell it to actually execute the query when it first loads `contractors` so that it has the actual values rather than the ""deferred"" values (I'm not sure if that is the right word)?

Thanks for the awesome library!

How to make a panorama interactive with hotspots (respond to mouse-over events),"I'm trying to work with this example: http://mrdoob.github.com/three.js/examples/webgl_panorama_equirectangular.html

It renders fine but I would like to now create some interactive mouse-over effects within this panorama, i.e. create hotspots.

Say, in the example above, if I wanted to create a hotspot over the chair, so when the user hovers over it, the chair grows slightly bigger (gets highlighted), or glows, or something like that. Basically I'm looking at how to identify and implement mouse-over and mouse-click events on items/areas within my panorama.

Any idea or help on how I could go about this? Thanks very much!

Problems using with maven 3,"Hi, this is not really an issue, but a couldn't find another way to contact you. I've been trying to use the plugin to generate a report of a project using maven 3.

Basically I'm having troubles for two reasons. The first one is that, in Maven 3, there isn't a reporting section anymore, the reports are configured directly in the maven-site-plugin. Anyway, even if a put the configuration inside the maven-site-plugin, or outside, in the reporting section, when I run

mvn site

The site is generated, but in the reports section there isn't the link to te concordion reports (or index). The reports are generated in the corresponding target/concordion directory, but that's all.

Do you have an example proyect or something that we could run to test the plugin? 

Thank you:)

"ruby: Add regexes, `%Q{}` strings, bug fixes","Hi Craig,

I missed regexes, so here they are now. Also, I rounded up a few corner cases. Let me know if there's anything you want me to change. In particular I wasn't sure if you wanted the unit test. Also, wasn't sure if the ""helper function"" approach was right.

---

New features:
1. Regexes (`//` and `%r{}` forms)
2. Custom-quoted strings (`%Q{}`, `%q{}`, etc)
3. ""unit test"" demo: `demos/ruby-test.html`

Bug fixes:
1. Heredocs now start on the next free line. Previously, in `foo(<<EOF)`, the last parens was mistakenly colored as part of the heredoc text.
2. `{` is now allowed to open strings and symbols. Previously, `{:key => 'value'}` and `{'key' => 'value'}` would not color `key` correctly.

I've been asked to change the way I was opening up the vnc page from just opening a new window to a pop up window (done in javascript).

Now while I can do this no bother I've been asked to resize the vnc window according to the canvas size and status bar height. Having been looking at your code for a while I guess I need to write a callback function to implement this correctly.

But before I did that I thought I should check with you if that's the best way to resolve this.

How incremental are these?,"Hey. Trying not to sounds too much like a total noob... 

I assume that since these will always fit inside 128 bits, they are incremental by nature of the time stamp, but only by that. Meaning they wouldn't start off lower and grow as the systems lifetime grew? I'm thinking if using this (or snowflake) to generate growing incremental IDs I can turn into a short URL via base62. 

Im not sure if this is what I'm looking for. Any advice would be _very_ much appreciated :-)

CLJS Sources should be looked up in CLASSPATH and :source-path,"In Maven (therefore in Leiningen too) both JAR and ZIP are valid artifact types. A JAR file can contain .class files, .clj files or other resource files. A ZIP file can contain resource files. Resources may also include .cljs files among other things. CLJS files can be distributed in source form via JAR and ZIP files uploaded to Maven repos.

Hence, it makes sense to pick up CLJS source files from CLASSPATH as well as from the source directory specified by `:cljsbuild ==> :builds ==> :source-path`. While looking up, the actual name of the file e.g. `foo/bar.cljs` should be used.

エアロスナップで場所を覚える,"終了時の場所を保存するように設定していても、Windows 7 のエアロスナップで
ウィンドウサイズを変えた場合にウィンドウ位置が復元されない。

最大化状態で終了すると最大化状態で起動されるのだから、
エアロスナップの位置も記憶して欲しい。

[スナップ - Windows 7 の機能 - Microsoft Windows](http://windows.microsoft.com/ja-JP/windows7/products/features/snap)
### ウィンドウサイズの記録処理
1. WM_DESTROY で `environ::save_geometry ()` を実行。
2. [GetWindowPlacement 関数](http://msdn.microsoft.com/ja-jp/library/cc364767.aspx) で
    [WINDOWPLACEMENT 構造体](http://msdn.microsoft.com/ja-jp/library/kb89946z.aspx) を取得
3. `rcNormalPosition` の left, top, right, bottom と showCmd を記録
   
   ``` ini
   [Misc]
   1440x900=(99,105)-(1435,903),3
   ```

showCmd の意味は以下のとおり。

``` c
/*
 * ShowWindow() Commands
 */
#define SW_HIDE             0
#define SW_SHOWNORMAL       1
#define SW_NORMAL           1
#define SW_SHOWMINIMIZED    2
#define SW_SHOWMAXIMIZED    3
#define SW_MAXIMIZE         3
#define SW_SHOWNOACTIVATE   4
#define SW_SHOW             5
#define SW_MINIMIZE         6
#define SW_SHOWMINNOACTIVE  7
#define SW_SHOWNA           8
#define SW_RESTORE          9
#define SW_SHOWDEFAULT      10
#define SW_FORCEMINIMIZE    11
#define SW_MAX              11
```

最大化状態も保存しているので起動後は最大化状態が復元される。
### 原因

エアロスナップでウィンドウサイズを変更した場合は、
GetWindowPlacement はスナップ前の位置を返す。
そのため、スナップしたサイズを保存できていなかった。
なお、スナップ後のサイズは GetWindowRect で取得できる。

c++ - GetWindowPlacement gives the incorrect window position - Stack Overflow
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5673242/getwindowplacement-gives-the-incorrect-window-position
### 対応

一時的にエアロスナップで縦半分に表示する場合もあると思うので、
位置を保存するかどうかは設定できるようにする。
- 共通設定→さまざまに以下の設定を追加
  
  ```
  □終了時にウィンドウサイズを保存
    □エアロスナップで変更した場合も保存
  ```
- 「終了時にウィンドウサイズを保存」のチェックを外した場合は、
  disable する
- エアロスナップで位置を保存する場合、GetWindowRect でウィンドウ位置を
  取得して WINDOWPLACEMENT 構造体の rcNormalPosition に設定する
- xyzzy.ini の書式は変更しない
### 備考
- Windows Vista 以前ではこのオプションを常に無効化したかったが、
  menu とは違い enable/disable の切り替えに任意の関数を指定できる
  わけではなさそうなので諦めた

Flickr - would like to bypass (or at least auto fill) attributes dialog,"I've posted this on StackOverflow but after a number of days I haven't received any advice on this issue.

[Link to SO post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9659290/sharekit-flickr-integration-want-to-bypass-or-at-least-auto-fill-attribute)

Ideally I'd like to suppress the presentation of the dialog (i.e., send without further user interaction) or if that is not possible, at least fill in the Title, Description and Tag fields with the variables from my app allowing the user to add to or override the values. Note that if I toggle the ""Auto Share"" switch to ""On"" the dialog is _still_ presented next time through.

When presented with the dialog, if I don't enter values for the Title, Description and Tag fields the values that I specify in my app for the SHKItem object that I allocate _are_ passed up to Flickr and appear with the image. If I override the values in this dialog then the image displayed on Flickr has those values, which is not desirable in my use case.

For Flickr authentication I've set the consumer key, secret key and callback URL in the my  custom configuator file and put a matching URL Scheme in the URL Types/URL Identifier row in the info.plist.

Is there something I have missed in configuring this sharing service or other advice you can give me to accomplish what I want to do.

Thanks

ghci and runghc fails,"I'm trying to debug why ghci behaves differently than ghc. Here is a succinct example with the corresponding output https://gist.github.com/57df6f71fa1144ec20cf
- Loading the file within ghci and running main outputs: ""Bus error: 10"" after a few seconds
- Running the file with runhaskell or runghc silently fails after a few seconds

This isn't a huge priority, but it would be very nice to test leveldb code without having to compile the source every time.

I'm not sure exactly why this is happening, but the backtraces for all dozen exceptions are completely consistent -- the error raises inside `redis/connection/ruby.rb:58`, while further up the backtrace it is being called from `sidekiq/middleware/server/unique_jobs:8`. Any ideas?

Double transitions with jqm 1.1-rc1 and phonegap 1.4.1 + fixed toolbars,"I am running jQM 1.1.0-rc.1 with PhoneGap 1.4.1 on an iPad 1 running iOS 5.   I have created a very simple application that uses $.mobile.changePage to load a few web pages from a web server, using the flip transition.

If you view the same set of pages in mobile Safari, it works fine.  Transitions are smooth and look good.  However, doing the same thing inside PhoneGap, every transition happens twice.  First the originating page flips out of view, then the new page appears in whole without a transition, then the transition effect occurs on the new page.

I have created a video to demonstrate the effect: http://youtu.be/EDZ-FM_rWi0  Hopefully it is not too shaky.

I've created a code snippet at http://jsbin.com/eyufam/54 that shows the basic structure of the pages, however, you won't see the problem unless you are running it inside a PhoneGap application.

The PhoneGap application is barely more than the ""Getting Started"" app found at http://phonegap.com/start#ios-x4 except that I have a different index file and the required jQuery libraries.   I will try to attach to this ticket.

I had filed a similar issue earlier and then closed it because I thought it was my code.   But this time, none of my custom logic is part of the app.    I have determined that the double transitions only occur when I have a header with data-position=""fixed"" .  Take out the fixed header and it works ok.

I'm not sure whether to post the issue with jQM or with PhoneGap, but the effect was not noticeable until I went from jQM 1.0.1 to jQM 1.1.0-rc.1

How to trigger Facebook authentication from Visual Studio solution.,"I am making good progress with my application built using Chaplin.  I am getting lists to display and I am currently working on editing my objects.  I want to thank you for building such an elegant framework.  I love backbone.js, but, I kept finding the need to fill in the missing gaps (e.g. controllers, disposing objects, pub/sub, etc.).  I am so happy I discovered Chaplin.

I develop in visual studio and I built a solution and migrated all the sample chaplin application files into it.  Because the sample Chaplin application has to be run using the mock domain chaplin.moviepilot.com I can not get the Facebook service provider to work when I run my visual studio application.  When running a visual studio application it just runs in localhost with a port number.  Eventually, I want to authenticate my users by using either Facebook, Gmail, Twitter, or allow them to create a user account.  Can you give some guidance on how I might run Facebook authentication without the need to use the mock domain chaplin.moviepilot.com?  So much depends on having an authenticated mediator.user that it is difficult for me to move forward.  

I have looked at the Facebook provider, however, I have to admit that it is beyond my skillset to understand right now.  I don't want to change the provider, I just want to enable my application to use the provider without running under the domain chaplin.moviepilot.com.  

Best regards,
Chris

First I would like to thank you for providing RequestReduce to the public. What a great tool you have created here! 

I have been testing it on my development machine, where everything seems to work fine. However, when I deploy to the production site, the results are not the same, and when I check the dashboard, I get errors like: ""There were errors reducing http://mysite.com/css/main.css"", ""RequestReduce had problems accessing http://www.mysite.com/WebResource.axd?"" and ""RequestReduce expected url 'http://www.mysite.com/WebResource.axd?... to have a mime type of 'text/css' "". I have using both RadScriptManager (yes, we are using Telerik´s ASP .NET controls) and the stock ASP :NET ScriptManager, and get errors with both of them. 

Do you have any idea what could be the problem here? Our web hosting company uses IIS clusters with load balancing, could this have something to do these problems?

Too much stuff in /lib/locomotive . Move to a locomotive-core gem?,"That folder is full of stuff. I would not mind it very much if it wasn't for the fact that I can use Spork to test changes on it, so I'm very slow on making changes to Locomotive using TDD.

Wouldn't it make sense to move all that code to a separate gem, with its own tests?

Odd glitch (possibly in randomization of context?),"So, for some reason, I typed in ""New Brunswick"" as the address.(no other info)

The survey all seemed fine, except at the end I realized that I had never been shown another context (e.g. DA, FED), asked perceptions of that area, if I liked or disliked the area, how the diversity of the area had changed, and the battery of closeness questions.  In other words, page 4 started off with the question, ""When it comes to social and political matters"" do you think of yourself as ethnic. 

I tried Ontario as the address and didn't have a problem.

I just tried New Brunswick again and the problem repeated itself -- page 4 started with the ethnic ID question.

npm breaks on Windows when running off a UNC path,"REPRO STEPS:
- create some UNC share on a different machine, e.g. `\\myserver\myshare\npmtest`
- In there, create a package.json with the following contents.
  
  {
        ""name"": ""app""
      , ""version"": ""0.0.1""
      , ""private"": true
      , ""dependencies"": {
          ""mkdirp"": ""0.0.7""
      }
  }
- Open a PowerShell window, and cd to `\\myserver\myshare\npmtest`. We can't use cmd here because it doesn't support cd'ing to UNCs.
- In there, run the following command. Note that we can't use npm.cmd here because we're using a UNC. So we run node and use the npm js file explicitly:

`node ""${env:ProgramFiles(x86)}\nodejs\node_modules\npm\bin\npm-cli.js"" install`

RESULT:

It fails with the following error:

NOTE: the same works fine when not using UNC. Note that in our real scenario, we're launching this programmatically from an exe. The use of PS is just the isolated repro.

DrRacket does not preserve newline convention of original file,"###### Originally submitted by Danny Yoo dyoo@hashcollision.org on: Thu Sep 29 12:56:01 -0400 2011

If I'm editing a file in DrRacket that has DOS-style newlines on my Ubuntu box, then DrRacket transparently translates the newlines to Unix convention.  This causes headaches in combination with traditional text diff tools.

``` racket
DrRacket should preserve the newline convention of existing files.
```

Add documentation and improved licensing fields to podspec,"I'm suggesting to add this simple changes to `spec.rb` without introducing any new logic at the moment.
### Documentation

Adding a new field for pointing to the Atom link of the documentation set of the Pod. Something like:

```
s.documentation = 'http://zwaldowski.github.com/BlocksKit/com.dizzytechnology.BlocksKit.atom
```

Then in the future it would be nice if `pod install` would add the documentation set to Xcode according to an user preference. appledoc adds the local documentation by compying it and running the following script:

```
tell application ""Xcode""
load documentation set with path #path#
end tell
```

I guess that the script could be easily modified to add the atom link.
### Licensing

Currently the podspec only specifies the kind of licence. It would be also nice to have a pointer to the license file itself. For example:

```
s.license_text = 'LICENSE'
```

In some cases like the ( facebook-ios-sdk)[https://github.com/facebook/facebook-ios-sdk] application a single license file is not provided. In that case it could be useful to specify the lines of a file containing the license. Something like:

```
s.license_text = 'src/FBConnect.h'
s.license_text_lines = '1..15'
```
