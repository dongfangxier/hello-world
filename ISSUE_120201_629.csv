Kind of hard though, it requires history rewrites (downstream forks will be broken and everyone will need to re-checkout) and some changes will make very old commits unbuildable and therefore only good as reference. I don't think this is a problem.

HTML5 FileAPI + Canvas

Vorgehensweise:
- Lokale Datei wird ausgewählt (via DnD oder Dateiauswahldialog)
- Datei wird auf Bild geprüft, wenn kein Bild dann normal Uploaden, wenn Bild dann weiter
- Bild skaliert in eine Canvas zeichnen (mit verschiedenen Graka Optimierungen wie AA/Filtering)
- Canvas.toDataURL() mit entsprechendem Bildtyp aufrufen
- Die skalierten B64 Daten an den Server schicken
- Server dekodiert B64 zu Binary und schreibt in ne Datei

Die Standard-Bild-Maximal-Größe für Uploads kann man vorgeben (wie jetzt auch), aber auch via Reiter ""Experten-Konfiguration"" Individuell anpassen (um automatisches Skalieren zu verhindern).

http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/file/dndfiles/

PS: Wenn toDataURL nicht klappt, könnte man auch Pixel für Pixel aus der Canvas auslesen, das Zippen, an den Server schicken, da wieder Pixel für Pixel in ne GD Canvas zeichnen und damit dann die Format Speicherung durchführen (gegebenenfalls mit PNG FilterOptimierung blablub)

Build and install library,"At the moment `src/Makefile` doesn't create a library, just an object file.
We want a library so that other programs can link it and also a `make install`.

Here is an example Makefile that might work:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/885451/makefile-for-shared-libraries

If this does work on the common systems (Linux and Mac with gcc and clang) I'd much prefer this simple solution over using autotools.

Also what compile options do we want? At the moment we have this:

```
CFLAGS=-Wall -g -std=c99 #-march=native -pipe -fomit-frame-pointer 
```

Ramin, I had to comment out some of the options you had used to make it work on my Mac.
I guess we want `-03` and not `-g` for speed tests?
Do you think we should use  `march`, `pipe` or `fomit-frame-pointer` for some reason?

Judging from this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7759696/what-does-this-error-suggest I would say that the error is due to us not deleting on object when we should. We'll have to take a close look at data reads from the server.

Running the server under valgrind would also be a good idea.

Implement a better SVMSearch algorithm,"Currently, SVMSearch performs something like two nested for loops and tries to find a combination of parameters that satisfies the required maximum error. While it uses constant steps for both C and Gamma, this can be a very lengthy process (esp. when the ranges are big) and finding optimal values is not guaranteed.

A better algorithm should be implemented, for example: 'A pattern search (also known as a “compass search” or a “line search”) starts at the center of the search range and makes trial steps in each direction for each parameter. If the fit of the model improves, the search center moves to the new point and the process is repeated. If no improvement is found, the step size is reduced and the search is tried again. The pattern search stops when the search step size is reduced to a specified tolerance.' (http://www.dtreg.com/svm.htm)

Add ability to disable paperclip-meta via an option,"I'm using STI to store info about attachments (images and non-images) in the DB.  Because it's STI, the table includes one meta column shared by both classes.

Solaris compatibility,"Hello!

I had trouble compiling stud on Solaris (specifically a Joyent smartmachine) so I made a few patches that affect the `Makefile` and `stud.c`.

Notes on the patches:

Using `fcntl()` and `O_NONBLOCK` is more portable than `ioctl` and `FIONBIO` on Unix (See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1150635/unix-nonblocking-i-o-o-nonblock-vs-fionbio#1151077 and also the libev source code).  Apparently `FIONBIO` is the way to do it on Windows.  I can change this to be inside a Solaris-specific #define if you'd like.

For the fclose()/fopen() -> freopen() change I was getting the following error from gcc:

```
stud.c:1812: error: lvalue required as left operand of assignment
```

For the USE_KEEPIDLE define, I wasn't sure if you'd rather this was defined in the Makefile or inside of stud.c itself.  I can easily change it to your preference.  Solaris doesn't let you tune the keep-alive interval per-socket, but does allow tuning it for the whole system via the `ndd` tool.

Let me know if there's any questions; I'm happy to have a conversation about these patches and make any changes you see fit.  

Note: I haven't done any significant testing of it (other than one-off testing), so if you're worried about stability I can wait, do some more testing, then get back to you.

Cheers,

Issues using AnythingSlider in a pluto portlet ,"I've got a porlet setup to display text/images using the AnythingSlider.  Each slide has very little decoration (maybe some bold text) and then an image.

My portal has multiple ""pages"" of portlets.

JQuery is used heavily throughout this portal for other parts of an internal framework I am using.  We are on version 1.8.12.

So the problem comes in when moving from the portal page with my AnythingSlider portlet to one of the other portal pages.  In the IE 9 developer tools I see a script error but it doesn't point to anything meaningful that I can tell.  When I click back to the page with the AnythingSlider portlet then the slider has stopped working.  I can't even click on the tabs to move from one item to the next.

If I stop the slider before clicking to another portal page then I don't see the script error and when I click back to the page with the AnythingSlider portlet then the slider works just fine.

Of course none of this is a problem in Firefox.

Is there anything I can do about this?  I thought about catching the window.unload event in order to stop the slider programatically, but this doesn't execute when moving from one portal page to another.

Discussion: Increase site width?,"Taken from #40,

@splitbrain:

> BTW. I also wonder if we should increase the max width a bit.

@selfthinker:

> Regarding max width, do you mean for the template in general or just for dokuwiki.org? Isn't great that it's so easy to change it, because it's just a simple variable in `style.ini`? :)
> I wouldn't mind to make it a bit wider in general, but it shouldn't get too wide. Keep in mind that the width is done as if viewed on a 1024 screen. (The whole width is 1008 px with default browser options.) But the main point is to keep the text readable. (Although there are no proper guidelines on this, see http://baymard.com/blog/line-length-readability and http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7460041/whats-a-good-maximum-width-of-text-on-a-webpage.)

iPhone issues - Unable to scroll and fancybox has a large space below it,"Hi there,

I have noticed that a few people are having issues with Fancybox on their iPads and iPhones, here's my two cents.

Firstly, and most importantly, I am unable to scroll on an iframe popup. There are no scrollbars, nor can I use my finger as this just scrolls the page in the background.

Secondly, there margin below Fancybox is quite large, which means the screen space is not being maximised.

Hoping there is a solution, as this is a great plugin! However at this rate I am going to have to find another. :(

gem dependency clash with rails 3.2.1,"Hello

Unicode support for links,"Take the following textile link example:

```
""Superhuman"":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhuman
""Übermensch"":https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Übermensch
```

This will be rendered as:

```
<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhuman"">Superhuman</a><br />
&#8220;Übermensch&#8221;:https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Übermensch</p>
```

The second link will not be parsed correctly, since it contains the Unicode character 'Ü'. This happens because the _links()_ function uses _A-Za-z_ in the regular expression:

``` python
        pattern = r'''
            (?P<pre>[\s\[{(]|[%s])?         #leading text

            (?P<atts>%s)                    #block attributes
            (?P<text>[^""]+?)                #link text
            \s?
            (?:\((?P<title>[^)]+?)\)(?=""))? #optional title
            "":                              #closing quote, colon
            (?P<url>(?:ftp|https?)?         #URL
                        (?: :// )?

        text = re.compile(pattern, re.X).sub(self.fLink, text)

Instead, _\w_ in combination with the _re.UNICODE_ flag should be used:

``` python
        pattern = r'''
            (?P<pre>[\s\[{(]|[%s])?         #leading text

            (?P<text>[^""]+?)                #link text
            \s?
            (?:\((?P<title>[^)]+?)\)(?=""))? #optional title
            "":                              #closing quote, colon
            (?P<url>(?:ftp|https?)?         #URL
                        (?: :// )?
                        [-\w+&@#/?=~()|!:,.;%%]*
                        [-\w+&@#/=~()|]

There are other occurences of the _a-z_ or _A-Z_ expression in the source code... they should maybe replaced too.

I expect the form to be submitted on save link click. Nothing happens instead, jQuery.yii.submitForm called, but nothing happens.

DDC-1632: one-to-many associations with fetch mode eager using too many SQL queries,"Jira issue originally created by user ausi:

I am loading a list of many entities.
These entities have a one-to-many association to other entities.
These other entities should be loaded in one single SQL query (instead of one query for every entity in the first list).

As discribed in the doctrine2 documentation: http://www.doctrine-project.org/docs/orm/2.1/en/reference/dql-doctrine-query-language.html#temporarily-change-fetch-mode-in-dql this should be possible with ""EAGER"" loading.

but it does not work as described.

my code:

```class User{
    /****
     \* @ORM\OneToMany(targetEntity=""Address"", mappedBy=""user"", indexBy=""id"", fetch=""EAGER"")
     _/
    protected $addresses;
    public function *_construct(){
        $this->addresses = new ArrayCollection();
    }
}

class Address{
    /****
     \* @ORM\ManyToOne(targetEntity=""User"", inversedBy=""addresses"")
     \* @ORM\JoinColumns({
     \*   @ORM\JoinColumn(name=""UserId"", referencedColumnName=""id"")
     \* })
     */
    private $user;
}

class UserRepository{
    public function findUsersWithAddresses(){
        return $this->getEntityManager()
            ->createQuery('SELECT u FROM MyBundle:User u ORDER BY u.name ASC')
            ->setFetchMode('MyBundle\Entity\User', 'addresses', \Doctrine\ORM\Mapping\ClassMetadata::FETCH_EAGER)
            ->setMaxResults(10)
            ->getResult();
    }
}

```

The method UserRepository::findUsersWithAddresses() executes 11 SQL Queries instead of 2 SQL Queries.

I am using:
* symfony v2.0.9
* doctrine-common 2.1.4
* doctrine-dbal 2.1.5
* doctrine 2.1.5

which it runs in `/usr/local/Library/Homebrew/utils.rb` line 270 or whereabouts.

I do have `cc` and friends:

WebSocket connection fails from 3G,"The WebSocket connection does not complete: the request is sent but there is no response.

(cometd.js line 1049)
_webSocket = new window.WebSocket(url);

See a more detailed description here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5557776/websockets-over-a-3g-connection

I suggest to put a new configuration property (connectionTimeout) default to 1 second, and create a timer which will end the websocket connection if we didn't get any response in any callback within the timeout, and thus fallback to long-polling.

We need this patch right now so I am going to develop it and upload it so that you can review.

SEC-1915: Add cutomisation of search filter in ActiveDirectoryLdapAuthenticationProvider,"[Tseliso Molukanele](https://jira.spring.io/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=tseliso%20molukanele) (Migrated from [SEC-1915](https://jira.spring.io/browse/SEC-1915)) said:

Currently the search filter used when retrieving user details is hard coded to '(&(objectClass=user)(userPrincipalName={0}))'.

When this hard coded filter is not consistent with the actual active directory instance it causes a org.springframework.dao.IncorrectResultSizeDataAccessException because the search returns with empty results after successful authentication.

A possible solution is to modify the class org.springframework.security.ldap.authentication.ad.ActiveDirectoryLdapAuthenticationProvider to allow a configurable search filter via bean configuration.

Another possible solution is to make the class org.springframework.security.ldap.authentication.ad.ActiveDirectoryLdapAuthenticationProvider extendable instead of final with protected instead of private functional methods to allow for easier customisation.

You can read more about then here:

Should we support dynamic dispatch?,"[@FroMage] Bill Burke asked me if we have _dynamic dispatch_. He described it thus:

> With dynamic dispatch you could write XML/JSON handlers that allow you to evaluate (and create) json on the fly just like Javascript does.  I really hate all the JAXB mess that Java has.  Its just way too cumbersome.

> I also bet you could do similar things around persistence too. 

It sounds to me like this is more than the interception we plan to have (because we're not intercepting calls on an instance), and more than Java's `Proxy` class (which only give you a dynamic implementation of a single interface), while being related to both, and also to our need for the JavaScript backend to have _dynamic types_ for all JS objects that are essentially untyped and dynamic.

That sounds useful, and related to three things we need.

@gavinking mentioned that @RossTate has been thinking about something related to this?

No way to order post or pages,"I notice people search for how to order page and post lists in Jekyll Bootstrap. Just so there is a place where this question is answered: 

**There is currently no way to pragmatically order pages or posts.**

The posts are ordered chronologically, while the pages are ordered alphabetically (to my knowledge). 

The only way to create your own order is to manually create an array in the _config.yml or YAML Front Matter pointing to the post/page urls, then iterate over that array.

This is one of the biggest drawbacks to sticking with the Jekyll framework. I'm currently scheming a solution for this =)

Ember changes behavior of Array iteration,"When Ember is in scope javascript iterates over an array in the following fashion:

``` javascript
var a = [1,2,3]
for (var i in a) {$('body').append(i + '<br/>');}
```

it enumerates methods of the array prototype as in:

> 0
> 1
> 2
> isEnumerable
> nextObject
> firstObject
> ...

Naturally it breaks few libraries in scope.
Here are examples with and without Ember in scope:

Safari+FF+Opera bug: Ended callback not firering after 2nd playback,"It took me more than 5 hours to find this, since I really need to be able to make my current project work on the iPad.

The bug happens in a very particular way, on both desktop and mobile version of Safari, Opera, and FF. Chrome just seems to not be affected while I still did not bother testing anything on IE yet.

I have a html5 audio player that has BOTH a `ended` and `timeupdate` handler. The thing is the `timeupdate` always fires as it suppose too, but the `ended` callback was only called on the first media, not the other ones. Since my animation is based on the `ended` callabck, I tried to 'recreate' the ended event in the timeupdate one.

`if (status.currentTime != 0 && status.currentTime >= status.duration) { ... }` 

Everything works now perfectly. I even got rid of the unnecessary `ended` call when setting the media. But I am sure the bug resides elsewhere in jPlayer's code.

Keep screen on using android:keepScreenOn attribute,"Hi @kevinsawicki - I wanted to check this tweak is good with you, unless you've already tried and rejected it?

Using `android:keepScreenOn` (which is added here to the airtraffic layout xml) doesn't require asking for the additional
WAKE_LOCK permission and also removes responsibility for managing the lock (the WindowManager takes care of keeping the sceen on so long as the activity shows) so I think it's generally preferred to the PowerManager method.

Tested on Galaxy Nexus - kept the screen on for the 5 minutes or so I was
watching it.

"added skip_callbacks functionality to ActiveRecord's save, create, destroy, update_attributes methods","I have recently been experiencing situations where I've wanted to create or save a record and not have the model's callbacks fire.  I have had to manually deal with this in my models by adding procs to the callback declarations, such as:

before_save :my_method, :unless => proc { should_skip_callback? }

...  Where a model has many callbacks, this can quickly become very tedious and result in noisy code.  So I have taken it upon myself to add this functionality within ActiveRecord, so you can now call:

Foo.create_without_callbacks
Foo.create_without_callbacks!
@foo.save_without_callbacks
@foo.save_without_callbacks!
@foo.update_attribute_without_callbacks(:bar, ""bar"")
@foo.update_attributes_without_callbacks(:bar => ""bar"")
@foo.update_attributes_without_callbacks!(:bar => ""bar"")
@foo.destroy_without_callbacks

I hope others will find this to be useful, I've seen quite a few posts on Stack Overflow where people are wanting to be able to do this:

Complete callback behavior for multiple yepnope calls,"Hi,

not sure it's a bug, but it seems like a change in behavior of the complete callback.
Previously, when calling yepnope multiple times, like so:

```
yepnope(['jquery.js', 'other.js']);

// ....later
yepnope({complete:function(){ console.log('lets go!', jQuery) }});
```

The complete callback in the 2nd call would fire once all files from the 1st call had been downloaded. Now it fires immediately, resulting in jQuery being undefined in the example above.

I also came across this question on stackoverflow, which uses the same technique: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7344843/yepnopes-complete-callback-question

Unfortunately I can't say when it changed, as I was using the Modernizr packaged version. I can't find out which yepnope version was packed with Modernizr 2.5.1, which used to work for me. Modernizr 2.5.3 and yepnope 1.5.3 are different.

Cheers, Thomas.

"Need ""no"" locale in addition to ""nb"" and ""nn""","It seems Norwegian language support isn't ideal in Android. There are two written forms of Norwegian, which each have their own ISO code: Norwegian bokmål (nb) and Norwegian Nynorsk (nn). Unfortunately ""Norwegian"" without any for specification also has an ISO code: no.

By law they are equal in Norway, but in practice, bokmål is far more prevalent and in use (80-90 % of written text is probably bokmål).

It seems both no and nb are used in Android: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5153674/android-localization-question

The only practical way to solve this seems to be to have two copies of Norwegian bokmål, one under ""nb"" and one under ""no"". Symbolic links are not supported on FAT filesystems, and thus the app cant be moved to memory cards, string aliases doesn't seem to be practical as one would still need to make the string files containing aliases(?), and I don't know of any way to ""prioritize"" languages (if no ""no"", then use ""nb"").

I've added a readme file to all folders containing nb and no noting that they should be kept in sync.

Deleting a Row with an open SubGrid row after it,"Hi!

I am using jqgrid with options subGrid=true, together with subGridBeforeExpand and subGridRowExpanded, also the reloadOnExpand: false.
when selecting a row in the grid and using the delRowData function, the row itself is removed from the screen, but the open subGrid row (and contents) are not removed.
I found an answer on Stack Overflow, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7181085/jqgrid-delete-row-does-not-delete-subgrid, but this is just a workaround.

The 'delRowData' method should consider the subGrid=true option and act accordingly.

Thanks,

Global configurations,"## Feedback

I would love to get some feedback on some of the additional configuration property methods that I added and your thoughts and commits on this idea in general. I'm not in love with what is going on here exactly but it does what it needs to do.
## Outline of Changes

Retrieving configuration at a target level should consult the project level. It now does that with this series of commits.
- Projects now have a `global_config(name)` and `global_configs`
- Targets and Projects are now `ConfigurationOwners`
- Classes can now be assigned more than one module from the Registry based on the `isa`
- Added a few missing attributes to the configuration.
- Configuration getter will look at the project configuration if no key is defined for the property
- Configuration properties now have `raw_#property` setter/getters
- Configuration properties now have `env_#property` to return the name of the property (e.g. `env_prefix_header` would return 'GCC_PREFIX_HEADER'
- Configuration properties now have `append_#property` which will append a value correctly to the values stored.
- Fixed bug with ArrayProperty
- Added a new KeyValueArrayProperty for arrays of [ ""KEY=VALUE"", ""KEY2=VALUE2"" ]

- I left behind a README.deadstones that I used for planning (and updated as my plans changed).  Feel free to delete it, but for now you may find it helpful to figure out the control flow.
- The new images are placeholders.  I'll be disappointed if they go live :).  My thoughts: ""territory-black"" should be a small solid black circle in the centre of a transparent image and ""dead-white"" should be a small solid black circle in the centre of a white ghost stone.  In both cases, the grid background underneath should be (partially) exposed.  But it doesn't matter, as long as they're clear and they aren't as ugly as the placeholders.
- Old _unfinished_ games should end up going through scoring, just like new games, when the second player passes.
- Old _finished_ games will remain unmodified, and no winner is declared (even if one of the players resigned).

it is applied. A positive number indicates how many items to keep

number keeps items from the end of the array.

  trim(5)  -> keep 1 2 3 4 5, drop 6 7 8 -> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  trim(-5) -> drop 1 2 3, keep 4 5 6 7 8 -> [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]

$trim is special as it is allowed (and required) to reference the same
field as another update modifier. It can not be used by itself, but
the same effect can be used by doing a $pushAll: [](pushing an empty

$trim is always performed after updating the field with any other

Non-matching join operation,"from @yarden on the mailing list

```
Hi,

I have a very common use case which pandas which involve a JOIN
operation related to coordinate arithmetic on two dataframes,
with queries like: for each entry in dataframe A, return all the
entries from dataframe B that have coordinates overlapping with
this entry. This join is not just matching on the columns values
of A and B, since the column values here are coordinates that
require simple arithmetic operations like intersection, overlap,
etc.

Following Wes's answer to someone else's question
here (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7837722/), I implemented
this in a naive way using iteration. My solution is extremely
inefficient however, probably in part since it is non-vectorized
and requires iterating through each element of the DataFrame.

Do you know of a more efficient/elegant way to do this?  The
naive implementation is unfortunately not workable for anything
even moderately large (e.g. dataframes with a couple thousand
entries.)

Complete example below. The first dataframe, df1, is made up of
two datasources, and each entry has a coordinate
column ""loc1"". The second dataframe df2 has an interval (start
and end coordinate) for each position. The ""join"" operation
function my_join() simply returns all the entry numbers in df2
that have intervals that contain the loc1 column from df1. The
join is not unique, so entries in df1 can be contained in
multiple entries in df2 (in which case they are stored as
comma-separated strings), or they can be contained in none of the
entries in df2, in which case the function stores the value
as ""-1"".

I'd like this to scale to instances where df1 and df2 contain
~50k entries. What is the best way to do this?

Thanks very much.

Pixels vs EM & Vertical Rhythm ,"Hi, 

Would you be interested in getting rid of Pixel measurements and taking a more flexible approach, using EM? 

For things like, for example Legend size, paddings for headings, alert blocks, buttons nav tabs. These things are more likely to be relative than absolute. 

Also, sizes of input controls, sizes or labels and many more things. All of them rely heavily on the base font size, and it will such an improvement to have all those things in a relative measurements (em) rather than absolute (px).

Embedded media appears over elements.,"This is a bit of a weird problem, especially because different browsers handle it differently. In browsers like Chromium, all embedded media acts as if it has a higher z-index than the top navigation bar. (fun fact: it's 1001)

Basically, embedded media just needs to be told in one way or another to not appear over the top bar, lightboxes, popup modals, and comment boxes. This is particularly bad on single-post views with embedded videos.

"Certain IE8 versions fail on ""this.xhr.onreadystatechange = this.xhr.onload = empty""","I am not sure, but in Etherpad-Lite developement we noticed, that certain versions of IE8 stalls while loading our pages and throw an javascript (undefined property or method) error in lines with A = B = C syntax like in  this.xhr.onreadystatechange = this.xhr.onload = empty; 

Firefox and Chrome work without problems.

Etherpad lite bug issue is https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite/issues/245#issuecomment-3775467 .

GitHub Pages plays poorly with Handlebars ,"GitHub Pages seems like a very convenient and powerful platform for collaborative development and deployment of single-page (eg, Ember) apps.  Unfortunately, there is a small syntactic conflict: both Liquid (used by Jekyll) and Handlebars use the ""{{ ... }}"" notation.

Getting these strings past Liquid to Handlebars can be done, but it's a nuisance.  My current workaround, for example, is to use ""{| ... |}"" and ""{|| ... ||}"" in place of ""{{ ... }}"" and ""{{{ ... }}}"". This works for me, but I'm not looking forward to explaining it to others.  Assuming that I'm not simply missing some existing solution, I'm not sure how the problem should be resolved.

One possibility would be to support alternative syntax in Handlebars (like I do, informally), but this seems awkward and error-prone. A better approach might be to have some sort of syntax in Liquid that disables its interpretation of these strings for selected sections of a document.

Should we support dynamic dispatch?,"Bill Burke asked me if we have _dynamic dispatch_. He described it thus:

> That you can write a class that can have attributes, fields and methods dynamically dispatched to a generic method call.
> 
> public class MyClass implements DynamicDispatch
> {
>   Object invokeMethod(String name, Object[] args, Type[] genericTypes) {...}
> 
>   void setField(String name, Object arg, Type genericType) {...}
>   Object getField(String name, Type genericType) {...}
> }
> 
> With dynamic dispatch you could write XML/JSON handlers that allow you to evaluate (and create) json on the fly just like Javascript does.  I really hate all the JAXB mess that Java has.  Its just way too cumbersome.
> 
> I also bet you could do similar things around persistence too. 

It sounds to me like this is more than the interception we plan to have (because we're not intercepting calls on an instance), and more than Java's `Proxy` class (which only give you a dynamic implementation of a single interface), while being related to both, and also to our need for the JavaScript backend to have _dynamic types_ for all JS objects that are essentially untyped and dynamic.

That sounds useful, and related to three things we need.

Everything works here - http://clip2net.com/page/m54198/22880874
But in another interface http://clip2net.com/page/m54198/22880875 - where I first call the creation of element 
I see a problem http://clip2net.com/page/m54198/22880880 
http://clip2net.com/page/m54198/22880882 - my js code was removed
Although the response from the server contains its.
What is the problem and how to fix it? 

If I try to create some element here http://demo.sonata-project.org/admin/sonata/news/comment/7121/edit - all works

Should we rename Void and Bottom?,"We find that `Void` (the top of the hierarchy) is not adequatly named, since it conveys the idea that it can only point to nothing.

Similarly we find that `Bottom` (the subclass of every type) is confusing for those unfamiliar with the notion (everyone except ML guys).

We proposed the following alternatives:
- Top/Bottom
- Unknown/Impossible
- SuperType/SubType
- Anything/?
- Defined/Undefined
- Value/NonValue

Note that `undefined` is a valid value in many languages and would therefore be confusing.

GitHub Pages plays poorly with Handlebars,"GitHub Pages seems like a very convenient and powerful platform for collaborative development and deployment of single-page (eg, Ember) apps.  Unfortunately, there is a small syntactic conflict: both Liquid (used by Jekyll) and Handlebars use the ""{{ ... }}"" notation.

Getting these strings past Liquid to Handlebars can be done, but it's a nuisance.  My current workaround, for example, is to use ""{| ... |}"" and ""{|| ... ||}"" in place of ""{{ ... }}"" and ""{{{ ... }}}"". This works for me, but I'm not looking forward to explaining it to others.  Assuming that I'm not simply missing some existing solution, I'm not sure how the problem should be resolved.

One possibility would be to support alternative syntax in Handlebars (like I do, informally), but this seems awkward and error-prone. A better approach might be to have some sort of syntax in Liquid that disables its interpretation of these strings for selected sections of a document.

Add maxlength attribute to CHtml::activeTextArea,"This is a feature request, not a bug.

It would be nice if CHtml:activeTextArea would render the maxlength attribute for textareas. This attribute is supported in HTML5 and already works in most current browsers.

object may override a def causing ClassCastException in unrelated code,"Given some class with a method

```scala
class A {
  def m() = 5
}
```

it is currently possible to override this method with an object definition:

```scala
class B extends A {
  object m
}
```

The compiler won't complain about this (and I'm not sure what the specification says about this specific situation), however the code will break wherever A is expected:

```scala
scala> ((new B): B).m    // compiles and runs
res: object B#m = B$m$@1e450448
scala> ((new B): A).m
java.lang.ClassCastException
```

As a possibly related phenomenon: It is currently not possible to override a parentheses-less def with an object.

```scala
class A2 {
  def m2 = 5
}
class B2 extends A2 {
  object m2
}
error: overriding method m in class A2 of type => Int;

MapActivity yields ClassNotFoundException,"Apparently to me, it seems that using `@EActivity` decorator on a MapActivity class is buggy. This is what I tried:

``` java
$ cat com/hello/annotations/HelloAnnotationsActivity.java 
package com.hello.annotations;

import com.google.android.maps.MapActivity;
import com.googlecode.androidannotations.annotations.EActivity;

@EActivity(R.layout.main)
public class HelloAnnotationsActivity extends MapActivity {

    @Override
    protected boolean isRouteDisplayed() {
        // TODO Auto-generated method stub
        return false;
    }

}
```

Layout:

``` html

RFC: Destructuring vectors syntax,"Currently its possible to destructure tuples, records, and enums in let's and alt patterns. It could be useful to also destructure vectors as well, plus it would feel more consistent.

The obvious goal would be to do something like this:

```
fn foldr<A, B>(func: fn(A, B) -> B,
               initValue: B,
               vals: [A]) -> B {
  alt vals { 
    [] { ret initValue; }
    [head, tail...]  { ret foldr(func, func(initValue, head), tail); }
  }
}
```

I am not sure of the syntax exactly but it would be useful to be able to destructure vectors at least in some way. 

Another example of why this might be useful:

```
fn ever_other_element<A>(vals: [A]) -> [A] {
  alt vals {
    [head, _, rest...] { ret [head] + ever_other_element(rest); }
    [head, _] {  ret [head]; }
    _ { ret []; }
  }
}
```

Could be expressed as:

```
fn ever_other_element<A>(vals: [A]) -> [A] {
  if vec::len(vals) > 2 {
    let head = vals[0],
        rest = vec::tail(vec::tail(vals));
    ret [head] + ever_other_element(rest);
  }
  else if vect::len(vals) == 2 {
    let head = vals[0];
    ret [head];
  }
  else {
    ret [];
  }
}
```

In my samples I am assuming that in this expression: `[head, tail...]`; `head` matches 1 element and `tail` matches 0+ elements. 

But, the difference is just that using pattern matching makes this a lot more readable. If this should apply to lists instead of vectors, let me know, but list's are in the core:: they are in std:: so, my assumption is that it makes more sense for vec to work this way.

 show facets onclick?,"This post can be found also here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9432478/visualsearch-js-how-to-show-facets-onclick

A feature which, according to my users feedback, is realy missing, is the possiblity to know, somehow, which are the available facets. My facets are many and it would be really nice to have a list of facets (maybe grouped) when clicking on the searchbox.

I had a look on the annotated source code, in particular to search_parser.js and to search_box.js.

I suppose that I've to trigger the click event on the element with VS-search-inner id. Or maybe another way would be to work on the parse function... I'm a little bit confused.

I also noticed the showFacetCategoryMenu which, unused at the moment, might implement the feature I'm searching for if modifyed.

So, in conclusion, my question are:

can anybody put me in the right direction?
which would be the right place to put my hands on, in order to implement the ""show available facets"" function?

Cookie support?,"Hi,

I finally hit a wall when I needed cookie support. I'm not a rubyist and my basic skills leave me stranded (for any practical approach).

There's a very limited implementation here:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1486703/how-to-implement-cookie-support-in-ruby-net-http

But that doesn't deal with path and domain restrictions. :/

Do you think you could give basic cookies a try? I guess I'd even be happy with that very simple implementation.

add global stdint.h support?,"vs2010 does not include stdint.h support:

https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ofxCv/issues/28

even though these bugs aren't in the core, i think OF is designed to make it easy for people to write cross-platform, cross-compiler code. so i propose that we add an explicit declaration of the missing types for vs2010.

this isn't really something i'm worried about directly since i don't use vs2010, but i know people like elliot do. and it would be cleaner to add it once to the core than to add it once for every addon that is broken.

the solution would probably look like: take dan's code from the above issue, and move it from ofxOsc into the core.

``` ruby
Globalize.locale = :en
post = Post.create(:title => ""a title"")
Globalize.locale = :ja
post.update_attributes(:title => ""タイトル"")
```

then get the post using a dynamic finder:

``` ruby
Globalize.locale = :en
post = Post.find_by_title(""a title"")
```

and then destroy it, it won't destroy the translation in the other language:

``` ruby
post.destroy
Post::Translation.all   # =>  [#<Post::Translation ... locale: ""ja"", title: ""タイトル"", ... >]

However, if instead of the dynamic finder you use a normal Post.find(<id>) on the id, then it works and properly destroys both translations.

"Running jQuery UI datepicker before applying bindings in a ""with"" breaks the datepicker","I'm not sure how widespread this issue is in general, but I'm having problems with jQuery UI's datepicker when applying bindings.

A JSFiddle repro is at http://jsfiddle.net/MRaKp/1/. Click the textboxes; the desired effect is for a datepicker to appear.

Three textboxes get datepicker applied to them:
- One inside a `data-bind=""with: ...""` that gets `.datepicker()` applied before the `ko.applyBindings` call. This one breaks.
- One inside a `data-bind=""with: ...""` that gets `.datepicker()` applied after the `ko.applyBindings` call. This one works.
- One outside a `data-bind=""with: ...""` that gets `.datepicker()` applied before the `ko.applyBindings` call. This one works.

Embedded interactive quiz in Baker?,"Hello,
     Let me start by saying I am a native iOS developer not a web or javascript developer, so this is probably a dumb question. 

Imagine a book created in Baker that is a lot like a textbook.   At the end of each chapter there are a series of questions that test you on the content in that chapter.   Would it be possible to fill in a form with the questions and have your answers graded?   This would have to be done in javascript would it not?   And could this all happen locally, without a webservice - off-line?

Also is there a version of baker or something similar that works on Android?

problem with already existing jobs,"hey!

I'm using guartz to run a job in my webapplication.
My webapp contains a method that creates the injector and a job for my class that implements quartz.Job.

The problem is, that the method can be called severall times ->
Error injecting method, org.quartz.ObjectAlreadyExistsException: Unable to store Job : 'DEFAULT.myJob', because one already exists with this identification.

Now i have three questions:
1) How can i catch the JobExecutionException from the execute(JobExecutionContext context) method in my main class where i created the injector?

2) Is there a way to test, if a job with a given name is already stored?

3) I have placed an @DisallowConcurrentExecution annotation in my class that implements quartz.Job. I hoped that this would  prevent to create several jobs for the same class. But this doesn't work. Why?

disentangle source-control from packaging,"Remove `git ls-files` from the gemspec.

I think this is one of those religious issues....

I get the value added of 'only release commited files'. But to me having git commands in your gemspec is a ""code-smell"" (these kids come up with crazy phrases). Essentially I'd argue you should be releasing a pure master or release branch, and that branch should have what is released, no-more-no-less. If you have files, etc that shouldn't be released these should be in the excludefiles for the development branch. Git's branching, squash commits, rebase etc means you can keep release/master neat while all the stuff that shouldn't be released is in the development branch.

<p>As far as I know, simply setting the appropriate model property is fine.
$relatedModel=...;
$model->relationName=$relatedModel;
$model->save(); // this also saves relatedModel to database.

Isn't this the same thing you ask for?</p><p><strong>jeff%tjwallace.ca@gtempaccount.com said, at 2009-08-06T20:15:04.000Z:</strong></p>

<p>I don't believe that is the case, take a look at this function with CActiveRecord:
public function setAttribute($name,$value)
{
    if(property_exists($this,$name))
        $this->$name=$value;
    else if(isset($this->getMetaData()->columns[$name]))
        $this->_attributes[$name]=$value;
    else
        return false;
    return true;
}

It only assigns to column names.

Also the build function would create un-saved related models for use in say the 
""tagging"" of a blog post.</p><p><strong>pestaa.hu said, at 2009-08-06T20:24:53.000Z:</strong></p>

            $this->_related[$name]=$value;
        else
            parent::__set($name,$value);
    }
}

This is invoked first, and this takes care of the relations.</p><p><strong>jeff%tjwallace.ca@gtempaccount.com said, at 2009-08-06T20:26:47.000Z:</strong></p>

<p>Will that take care of foreign key assignment?</p><p><strong>pestaa.hu said, at 2009-08-06T20:43:07.000Z:</strong></p>

<p>Please override CActiveRecord with this:

public function __set($name,$value)
{
    if($this->setAttribute($name,$value)===false)
    {
        if(isset($this->getMetaData()->relations[$name]))
        {
            $relation=$this->getMetaData()->relations[$name];
            $foreignKey=$relation->foreignKey;
            if($relation instanceof CHasManyRelation || $relation 
instanceof CHasOneRelation)
                $value->$foreignKey=$this->getPrimaryKey();
            else
                $this->$foreignKey=$value->getPrimaryKey();

        }
        else

Including the Byte Order Mark (BOM)/Preamble for yml files breaks Ruby yml parsing,"TL;DR:
Only add the UTF8 BOM/Preamble to .sln files.  Or only add the BOM to those files that originally contained it.

If you WarmuP a template that contains a .yml file, this line adds the Byte Order Mark/Preamble for UTF8: https://github.com/chucknorris/warmup/blob/master/warmup/TargetDir.cs#L82

The WriteAllText method that is currently being used writes the BOM as the first byte in the file.

Ruby's core yml library reads the BOM as part of the key (the yml is read..but the hash created contains the BOM...not so great...rails applications uses config.yml...it breaks stuff to say the least...)

Also, based on this StackOverflow answer, it is apparently not a good thing to add the BOM to xml files:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1317700/strip-byte-order-mark-from-string-in-c-sharp

The BOM is unfortunately required for .sln files so that VSSelector can open the solution and not crash.

"Passenger processes hang on memcached poll, even with Rails.cache.reset stanza or in conservative spawn","Hoping to get some help on this recently-developed issue with our Passenger processes seizing up during or immediately following an exchange with memcached. We're set up on EC2, using m1.large:
- Rails 3.1.1
- Ruby 1.9.2
- Apache2 / Passenger 3.0.11(both smart_lv2 and conservative spawn methods)
- Couchbase 1.8, on its own m1.large
- have seen this with dally 1.1.5 and 1.1.4 + kgio

We're only using dalli for the Rails.cache (not for sessions), and are using the Passenger environment.rb stanza currently as below:
`if defined?(PhusionPassenger)
PhusionPassenger.on_event(:starting_worker_process) do |forked|
Rails.cache.reset if forked
end
end`

Over time, we can see our processes, using passenger-status, begin to seize up suddenly, eventually maxing out the pool and effectively shutting down passenger. This tends to happen in spurts--a box will be fine for a while, then lock up four or six processes, then coast by on the remaining processes for a while before eventually eating them all.

We're stumped at the moment, in that this happens both on smart_lv2 and conservative spawning--the latter of which we had assumed would obviate any concerns at all about shared file descriptors. Watching strace, we see the processes talk to memcache successfully for a long while, ultimately ending in in a poll(), write(), read(), and then going silent.

I'm hoping for any clues you might be able to offer on this, or, if I'm posting this in entirely the wrong place, a suggestion of somebody I'd be better off asking. Otherwise, thank you for the work on dalli--it's obviously been a great friend of ours through thick and thin.

straces--both of a request that seized up, and of one of the many that worked--follow:

CLinkPager - Inconsistency in parameters,"When using CLinkPager, first page (page=1) does not contain any parameter. All following pages would contain:
page=2
page=3
...
which are submitted when switching between pages.

This is the problem when trying to make filter remembered, because &quot;not submitting the page parameter&quot; means restoring previous page number from session. So when I come to page number 2, I can never switch to page 1, because the page=1 is never submitted.

Would it be possible to add parameter &quot;page&quot; to navigation buttons by default always?

The problem has also been discussed here:

There's some detail on this issue here:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8756418/static-library-with-arc-support-linked-to-non-arc-project-causing-linker-errors

Apparently there's a bug in LLVM, and it may not automatically include the library that gives support to 4.3 devices.  You can force it by including the linker flag `-fobjc-arc` (note: linker flag for the target, not for an individual files).

I think CocoaPods could detect this scenario and add the appropriate setting in `Pods.xcconfig`.

I don't believe this is an issue if the main project is configured to use ARC.

It seems that cucumber made a breaking change, and either moving back to 1.1.4 or tracking their master would get around this issue.  May be related to the travis-ci issue.

Note: I did not have this issue on Ruby 1.9.3 which I've been developing on most of the day.

Bug in SessionPerRequestModule,"I believe there might be an issue with the SessionPerRequestModule, but I'm not completely sure.  Sharp Lite has been working fine for months, but after updating to the latest version (from about a month ago) I started getting the following exception:

It is complaining about the Dispose method in SessionPerRequestModule.  This post seems to indicate that code is unecessary:

Cell content wrongly rendered in firefox,"Firefox does not seem to be able to render cell contents correctly. Symptom is that cells with a number value (including formulas with a number result) do not seem to display their value.

Root cause seems to be that firefox ignores the ""position:relative"" of table cells, which makes the span inside the cells (which uses position:absolute) to be rendered off screen for numbers (which use right: 0px)

Flash messages,"This one is really for the design team.

Rails uses a feature called flash messages to communicate with the user. For example, if you log in but give the wrong password, it uses a flash message to tell the user that.

A place for these flash messages needs to be designed into every page.

Flash messages can be found in the templates using in the `flash` method. It returns a hash with possible keys of `:alert`, `:warning`, and `:error`.

The template needs to test whether there is a value for each of those keys and display it appropriately, for example, wrapped in a `div` with a class matching the type of flash message, plus styling.

Putting this in a partial template would keep the parent template cleaner.

Getting a 400 error when deauthorizing app,"Using the Facebook C# API release version from 12/20/2011, I'm calling the facebook client Delete command with ""/{facebook id}/permissions"" I get a 400 Bad request returned to me. I've tried the following variations too: ""{facebook id}/permissions"", ""/{app id}/permissions"", ""{app id}/permissions"", ""/{facebook id}/permission"", ""me/permissions"" and ""/{app id}/permission"". I've issues other delete commands (such as deleting a comment, removing a like, and deleting a feed posting) thru the C# API with success.

This documentation reference says you're to issue a delete command to {profile id}/permissions

https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/rest/auth.revokeAuthorization/

I've tried using {facebook id}/permissions on the delete command via the Graph Api Explorer (https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer?method=DELETE) and it works there. So I'm confused why I'm only getting a 400 bad request for the removal of authorization.

https://graph.facebook.com:443/me/permissions?access_token=xxxx is the uri being passed into the CreateHttpWebRequest() method. Content type is ""application/x-www-form-urlencoded"". When _httpWebRequest.GetResponse(); is called, that's when a WebException is thrown in line 680 of HttpHelper.cs.

Which is a strange response because I can run the delete of permissions from the graph API explorer without getting this error.

Use `$(el).val()` instead of `el.value` for compatibility with plugins that define custom `valHooks`,"Example use case: https://github.com/mathiasbynens/jquery-placeholder/issues/29#issuecomment-4104352

In my placeholder plugin, I patch `val()` through `valHooks`, so that it only returns the element’s `value` if the fake placeholder text is not being displayed at that point. That way, as long as you use `.val()`, you get the exact same behavior as you would in a browser that has a native `placeholder` implementation.

It would be awesome if your validation plugin would use `$(el).val()` instead of `el.value`, as it would improve compatibility with plugins like this that define custom `valHooks`.

Wrong plural form of model names in other locales then :en,"Model names can be translated using standard i18n setup, but the pluralization still uses the english standard (ending ""s""). For example: ""User"" and ""Users"" would be ""Bruger"" and ""Brugere"" in danish (da), but in active admin it appears as ""Bruger"" and ""Brugers"". 

I have looked a bit around, and found that this can be fixed with a ""hack fix"" using inflections rules. This sounds like the inflection method pluralize is being used to pluralize the model names? It definitely looks like this is the method:

``` ruby
module ActiveAdmin
  class Resource
    module Naming
      #....
      def plural_resource_name
        @plural_resource_name ||= @options[:as].pluralize if @options[:as]
        @plural_resource_name ||= plural_human_name
        @plural_resource_name ||= resource_name.pluralize
      end
     #....
```

Correct me if wrong, but the method pluralize should not be used for translations, the rails inflector is mainly used for Rails internals, like guessing table names for models (see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6178900/overide-default-pluralize-for-model-name-in-rails3 for short explanation).

Forcing a specific SSL version (for use with Mechanize),"Ehlo,

as pointed out in http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9150032/using-mechanize-or-even-nethttp-with-ruby-1-9-returns-opensslsslsslerro, some servers might have issues with renegotiating an SSL version, and so in that case it'd be more than handy to force a specific version right away when trying to establish a connection.

This is pretty much a feature request in the way of what the Net::HTTP object's ssl_version method does - so one would be able to use that particular functionality from the Mechanize gem via net-http-persistent (like, 'agent.ssl_version = ""SSLv3""').

$ti_datebox.trigger('datebox', {'method':'set', 'value': theDateStr, 'date':theDate})

Redirect loop for mobile users,"We released our Facebook application Am I Interesting (http://apps.facebook.com/amiinteresting) earlier this week, and have since then gotten complaints that the application cannot be accessed from mobile phones, both iPhone and Android. So I tried from my fiancé’s phone, and after realizing that I had to configure a mobile URL in the Facebook application settings, I can replicate the problem and get this error message:

""The mobile version of the app ""Am I Interesting"" is unavailable because it is misconfigured. It appears to be caught in a redirect loop.""

The Facebook application configuration setting for Mobile Web URL points to http://www.amiinteresting.net.

The first redirect to the application, which is to www.amiinteresting.net (as configured), works fine. The error occurs after choosing to login and we use the Facebook C# SDK to authenticate and redirect back to the application. That redirect goes to apps.facebook.com/amiinteresting, which is what we want the “normal” web redirect to go to, but it seems that the mobile web applications for Facebook need their own domain and shouldn’t use the apps.facebook.com/XXXX format. But that's just a hypothesis of mine.

Here’s my configuration in web.config:

<facebookSettings
appSecret=""xxxxxx""
appId=""xxxxxx""
canvasPage=""http://apps.facebook.com/amiinteresting/""
canvasUrl=""http://www.amiinteresting.net/""
secureCanvasUrl=""https://www.amiinteresting.net"" />

I’m using version 5.3.2.0 of the SDK.

I have also posted this issue on Stack Overflow:

move namespaces from the envelope to the body,"It seems that there is a bug in some web service frameworks, such Apache CXF,
that in some cases, it fails to parse the body if the namespaces are declared only in the soap envelope node.

See: SOAP re-declaring qname inside body
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8819989/soap-re-declaring-qname-inside-body

scalaxb is declaring all the namespaces in the envelope node,
and even if this is correct,
it might be better to declare the namespaces inside the body (which is also correct)
as a workaround to these buggy common web services frameworks.

I modified scalaxb locally as follows and it works ok now for me with Apache CXF:

in soap11.scala, replace:

<pre><code>val merged = scalaxb.toScope(((Some(""soap11"") -> SOAP_ENVELOPE11_URI) :: scalaxb.fromScope(scope)).distinct: _*)
val r = in map  { scalaxb.toXML(_, Some(SOAP_ENVELOPE11_URI), Some(""Envelope""), merged) match {
</code></pre>

<pre><code>val soapScope = scalaxb.toScope((Some(""soap11"") -> SOAP_ENVELOPE11_URI));
val r = in map  { scalaxb.toXML(_, Some(SOAP_ENVELOPE11_URI), Some(""Envelope""), soapScope) match {

Sometimes the slideshow advances too fast and too many times,"This happens at least in Firefox, when you open a browser tab with Photoslider, then look away for a while, and get back to the Photoslider page. When you get back, the slideshow advances slides many times in a row, depending how long the Photoslider tab was inactive.

The fix is to probe if the slideshow is in the active tab or not, and preventing the transition to be ""queued"" if it's not in the active tab. No other changes are needed, because we don't need to reset the slideshow timer.

clickHandler interaction in Firefox not always firing (solved),"I noticed that the clickHander interaction wasn't always correctly triggering in FF in my application.

var xyz = /(\d+)\/(\d+)\/(\d+).[\w._]+/g.exec(url);

I replaced this line with:

var rx = new RegExp(""/(\d+)\/(\d+)\/(\d+)\.[\w\._]+"");
var xyz = rx.exec(url);

And now it seems to be fine. Might just be an issue at my end. I found the solution in some comments in this Stack Overflow question: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4724701/regexp-exec-returns-null-sporadically

When users were submitting their preferences if they were to reject a student the page would display js error on page not letting users to submit. Tauber staff experienced the same issue as well. Issue has been reproduced by Suleyman using hs office computer having IE 7. 

Solution: IE 7 does not support native js trim() function which has been used at line 320 of RankStudents.js file. Site.Master page has been updated to include

jquery plugin seems to disrupt the function of the wordpress plugin 'Twitter Facebook Google plus one Social Share'?,"Hi, firstly i would like to say i think your plugin and what you are collectively responsible for is wonderful!

my issue: for some reason i could not get the infinite scroll wordpress plugin working on my wordpress site, however i was able to get the jquery plugin working instead by adding the .js file and the appropriate code to the header.php file. 

On my wordpress site i am using a plugin ( http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/twitter-facebook-google-plusone-share/ )which adds the facebook 'like' button, the google 'plus one' button and the twitter 'tweet' button to posts, and this works fine until a secondary page of posts is loaded in via infinite-scroll - the google and twitter buttons do not render correctly within the additional posts? 

Am i correct in thinking i need to add code to address this within the ' function(newElements){ ' area of the code? 

The site is at: http://www.basedonbirds.com/iath/ 

Any help would be most appreciated, though if i have posted this query in the wrong area please let me know. Thanks

Datareader already open when sharing connection between sessions in SQL Server,"Hello

I have a WEB application with about one hundred users accessing concurrently and using BLToolKit succesfully. 

However sometimes ( may be once a mounth, when workload is great ), I get this error repeatedly :

""There is already an open DataReader associated with this Command which must be closed first""

and y have to restart the services.

My app shares the DBManager connection object for all seassons within a singleton pattern. I use SQL Server 2008. Searching the internet, i found that this is a popular issue, not exclusive from BLtoolkit. It is said that the solution is to enable MARS in connection string. The parameter is ""MultipleActiveResultSets=True"". However this did not solve the problem.

I hope I have isolated the failure in this code snippet, inspired in this post http://ayende.com/blog/1482/static-thread-safety :

```
using System;
using System.Data;
using System.Data.SqlClient;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Diagnostics;
using BLToolkit.Data;
using BLToolkit.Data.DataProvider;

using System.Threading;


static class Program
{
    static DbManager shared_db ; 

    static void Main()
    {
        SqlDataProvider dp = new SqlDataProvider();

        try
        {
            shared_db = new DbManager(dp, ""Data Source=sharepointer;Database=Northwind;Integrated Security=SSPI;MultipleActiveResultSets=True"");
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(ex.ToString());
            throw ex;
        }

        Thread t1 = new Thread(GetData);
        Thread t2 = new Thread(GetData);

        t1.Start();
        t2.Start();

        Console.ReadKey();

    }

    private static void GetData()
    {
        Console.WriteLine(""Thread iniciado"");
        shared_db.SetCommand(""SELECT EmployeeID FROM Employees"");
        Thread.Sleep(500); // if I comment this, I get NullReferenceException instead

        using (var rd = shared_db.ExecuteReader())
        {
            int i = 0;
            while (rd.Read())
            {
                Console.WriteLine(""{0}"", ++i);
                Thread.Sleep(500);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

I have done a great effort in solving outside the bltoolkit library it but the only thing I get is to delay de failure. Is very important to me to get my app stable, i would appreciate any help. Anything i can do, please make me know. 

Thanks from Bilbao.

2.11: Opera bug with chosen plugin width is still exists,"This issue is related to #3627

![](http://gyazo.com/5fda60f0d86220a626887c2dfb76c816.png)

And, I think know why: **Opera doesn't return width and height value (and other styles) for hidden elements!**
Here are some bug reports I found: 
- [getStyle and Opera](http://www.mooforum.net/general12/getstyle-and-opera-t3396.html)
- [[Moo] getStyle from not loaded Element in Opera](http://mootools-users.660466.n2.nabble.com/Moo-getStyle-from-not-loaded-Element-in-Opera-td5811710.html)
- [Element.getStyle('height') is wrong for hidden elements in Opera](https://prototype.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8886/tickets/487-elementgetstyle-and-getheight-and-opera-962)

Also, I try to make this in `chosen-uncompressed.js`:

``` js
        this.f_width = this.form_field.measure(function() {
            // PATCH: measure elements in collapsed palettes (see #3627)
            //return this.getSize().x;
console.log(this.getStyle('width').toInt());
console.log(this.style.width);
            return (this.getSize().x > 0) ? this.getSize().x : this.getStyle('width').toInt();
        });
```

and here is a result:

![](http://gyazo.com/f5ea4395fe725ebd36adc278449c4c83.png)

It returns `-4` and ` `(empty) values. Also code`console.log(document.getElementById('gx3g2ktm').style.width)` have the same result.

So, this happens only in Opera. I can propose this solution: add `data-width` attribute for every select element and then in `chosen-uncompressed.js` use this:

``` js
        this.f_width = this.form_field.measure(function() {
            // PATCH: measure elements in collapsed palettes (see #3627)
            //return this.getSize().x;
            return (this.getSize().x > 0) ? this.getSize().x : this.get('data-width').toInt();
        });
```

and use something like that: http://stackoverflow.com/a/7141517

Invisible split action bar reacts tapping,"Thanks this great libarary in advance.

I found the title issue in my phone (API 10). 

Split action bar can be visible but  still  handles tapping events
when the `hide()` method is called  in `onOptionsItemSelected()`,  not  in `onCreate()`.
If I post `hide()` in `onCreate()`, the issue occurs too.

This does not occur in API 15 emulator.

I think this issue is related to the following article.
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4728908/android-view-with-view-gone-still-receives-ontouch-and-onclick

If I call the `clearAnimation()` method of the split view like below,  the issue doesn't occur. 

``` java
// ActionBarImpl.java
 if (mSplitView != null && mContextDisplayMode == CONTEXT_DISPLAY_SPLIT) {
    mSplitView.setVisibility(View.GONE);
    // added
    mSplitView.clearAnimation();
 }
```

But, this solution is not the best, I think.
Native action bar implementation seems to be the same as ABS's at this point.

Data round tripping issue (not enough precision),"We currently specify in the [API spec](http://json-ld.org/spec/latest/json-ld-api/#data-round-tripping) that doubles should be normalized using the C-equivalent `%1.6e`. That is wrong as it [doesn't result in a number with double precision](http://www.json-ld.org/playground/?json-ld=%7B%22test1%22%3A10000.123%2C%22test2%22%3A100000.123%2C%22test3%22%3A999999.123%2C%22test4%22%3A99999999999999960000%7D&frame=%7B%7D) and wouldn't even be able to represent a number like `100000.123`.

I didn't have the time yet to investigate how this can be solved, but I found at least [one source](http://www.hunlock.com/blogs/The_Complete_Javascript_Number_Reference) (apart from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Json#Data_types.2C_syntax_and_example)) that says that in JavaScript all numbers are 64 bits.

We should also add some test cases for these round tripping issues.

bad quoting in git commands (pull and maybe others) on windows,"the escaping of the commands used for git cli should be fixed for it to work on windows: current code generates

git ""--git-dir=d:\etc\/.git"" ""--work-tree=d:\etc\"" pull

which gives this error:

a better syntax is

git --git-dir=""d:\etc\/.git"" --work-tree=""d:\etc\"" pull

The fix is the following:

```
private function git_run($command)

        $cmd = '(cd '.escapeshellarg($this->repository_path).' && git '.$command.')';

Binding a Datetime Hex-Format,"Hi there!

This is different from the other Ticket I opened. There I had a clear bytewise distinction. Here I have something like shown here:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/719129/datetime-hex-format

My Format is not exactly the same, but the same idea, the number of bits differ in some places. Here is my dirty implementation that works for now. But is kind of ugly since I convert the bytes to strings representing the bits, and then split and join them together with substring.. but just look at the code:

<pre>
    @BoundNumber(size = ""8"")
    byte date1;
    @BoundNumber(size = ""8"")
    byte date2;
    @BoundNumber(size = ""8"")
    byte date3;
    @BoundNumber(size = ""8"")
    byte date4;

    Date getDate() {
        String s1 = MyTools.right(Integer.toBinaryString(date1), 8, '0');
        String s2 = MyTools.right(Integer.toBinaryString(date2), 8, '0');
        String s3 = MyTools.right(Integer.toBinaryString(date3), 8, '0');
        String s4 = MyTools.right(Integer.toBinaryString(date4), 8, '0');

        int year = Integer.parseInt(s1 + s2.substring(0, 4), 2);
        int month = Integer.parseInt(s2.substring(4), 2) + 1; // zero based,
                                                                // therefore +1
        int day = Integer.parseInt(s3.substring(0, 5), 2);
        int hour = Integer.parseInt(s3.substring(5) + s4.substring(0, 2), 2);
        int minute = Integer.parseInt(s4.substring(2), 2);

        return MyTools.getDate(year, month, day, hour, minute);
    }
</pre>


The MyTools.right gives me the rightmost 8 (parameter2) chars of the given string, and if there are less chars fills up on the left with '0' (parameter3)

What is the best approach to identify the Schedule ?,"Hey,
i would like to identify the details of an schedule. e.g:

i have the schedule for an event: _event.schedule_

```
""Every 3 months on the 10th day of the month""
```

represented by the hash:

```
  {
   :start_date=>2012-02-06 10:37:04 +0100, 
   :rrules=>[{
     :validations=>{
       :day_of_month=>[10]}, 
       :rule_type=>""IceCube::MonthlyRule"", 
       :interval=>3
    }], 
    :exrules=>[], :rdates=>[], :exdates=>[] 
  }
```

to set the specific form elements (dropdown, checkbox) i need to evaluate the specific rules. e.g. for

```
  event.schedule.interval 
```

i would expect

```
  IceCube::MonthlyRule
```

i did not found any methods in the source, does somebody did sth. similar ? My approach would be to parse the hash and extract every rule...

Generic Views,"Since Django 1.3, there are generic views that use default template names if you don't specify one (e.g. the DetailView).

Maybe you have to load all views (e.g. by defining a list of view modules) and then extract the `template_name` from each of them.

Error on JSON deserialiation on migrated questions.,"Hey there.

I'm using BridgeStack to write a script that goes over questions on StackOverflow, and I think I found a bug that causes a crash during JSON deserialization, when the results include a question that was migrated to a different site. Is this a known bug?

This is the exception:

> Newtonsoft.Json.JsonSerializationException was unhandled.
>  Message=Error converting value ""main_site"" to type >'System.Nullable`1[BridgeStack.SiteTypeEnum]'. 
> In Json.cs, line 44 

(I can get a full stack-trace, if you want).

I define my QuestionQuery like this:

```
 stackClient.Default.Site = NetworkSiteEnum.StackOverflow;
 var query = new QuestionsQuery
 {
     PageSize = 30,
     Sort = QuerySortEnum.Creation,
     Order = QueryOrderEnum.Descending
 };
```

and the returned JSON includes this question:

Suggestion for Ember.View.create() + {{view}},"Based on my response to this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9094811/ember-nested-applications-and-widgets

Fiddle of the example on the homepage: http://jsfiddle.net/PastryExplosion/LTRt2/

In order to illustrate view hierarchy, the following example is given.  Most of the JSFiddles on SO also use this paradigm.  But using extend() like this doesn't make sense from an OO standpoint as the description of the View is being intertwined with the data itself.  Moreover, the only way to render this is by directly calling the extended class.  Why would one render a description directly?

It also seems to conflict with the examples of Ember.ViewState I've seen floating around, which do use Ember.View.create().

The second line in the JSFiddle (and the natural result of designing my models according to the SO post above) is the way I'd prefer to solve this problem.  This would be particularly important for times when I have a CollectionView of heterogenous items (e.g. I'm making a dynamic web form and I don't know the input classes until I get the template from an AJAX call), especially when each individual view has a templateName specifically defined.

Configuration of Namespace throws exceptions,"I think my confusion is a byproduct of old documentation/blogs and just traditional ignorance but I'm havin' issues with namespaced configs.

 I have the following structure:

```
▾ app/
  ▾ admin/
      agents.rb
      dashboards.rb
  ▾ agency/
      agents.rb
      dashboards.rb
```

I don't see a means to set a namespace within the dashboards so as of right now they are both essentially:

```
ActiveAdmin::Dashboards.build do
end
```

The agents have the following declarations:

```
ActiveAdmin.register Agent, :namespace=>:agency_admin do
```

and

```
ActiveAdmin.register Agent, :namespace=>:admin do
```

This all works fine with a default config. I can pull up /agency_admin/agents or /admin/agents just fine.  However, as soon as I add a config such as what comes commented out as an example within the initializer:

```
   config.namespace :admin do |admin|
     admin.site_title = ""Custom Admin Title""
   end
```

I get the attached exception stream when starting the server. I appreciate any/all help on this.

As an aside, the reason I am doing this is to provide different devise methods per namespace. From what I could tell in the source, it's possible to do so (at least what's on the current master) as the base_controller obtains that information from the namespace. I realize a lot of people recommend using CanCan but that's not something that I want nor can, do at this point.

Thanks again in advance!

Command refactor,"Refactored the Command functionality from a monolothic CommandManager class into a light command factory with individual commands in concrete classes. Command factory utilises Ninject to fetch commands (which are registered with the IOC container, currently using reflection, this could easily be refactored to static list of types in the factory class for perf reasons).

Commands can now be extended without touching existing code. Theoretically should be more in line with SRP and more testable. I'm not 100% the one class per command model is the way to go, and that the IOC container is the right place for individual commands to be fetched from. Seeking advise from the team on this.

Note this Pull request is just for review and should not be merged. Most tests still need to be refactored.

Newtonsoft dependency mismatch,"Hi,

I've just upgraded to SignalR 0.4.0
Part of package install tells me 'Successfully added 'Newtonsoft.Json 4.0.8'
When I run up my app, I get:Could not load file or assembly 'Newtonsoft.Json, Version=4.0.7.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=30ad4fe6b2a6aeed' or one of its dependencies. The located assembly's manifest definition does not match the assembly reference. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80131040)
So it looks like SignalR is still looking for an older Newtonsoft assembly.
Can I fix this manually?
Any help is much appreciated

Cheers

The popups work (am using Fancybox), but when I click a hyperlink to go to another page, it doesn't work - I just get an empty div. Is there a way to tell your script when to assume it's a hyperlink opposed to an anchor / a div that must be unhidden?

I inject easyxdm to the page and use it on various blogging software on the web for my widget purposes. It's strange but on some platforms I get the following error:

verify packages before running them non-interactively,"Please add some cryptographic checking on the validity of updated packages.

Right now it's pretty trivial to attack anyone using Package Control: just DNS spoof sublime.wbond.net at some coffee shop where a sublime developer goes, and serve up ""updates"" to all possible packages that contain malware.  Sublime will then instantly load whatever arbitrary python code the attacker want to send, and execute it locally, as soon as our unfortunate developer opens their laptop.  Good bye credit cards, et cetera.

Both the update listing and the packages themselves should be signed in some way.  Since most packages are on GitHub, a regular old HTTPS certificate check everywhere, while not ideal, would be a good start.  The curl and wget downloaders will sometimes verify a cert, but that depends on local configuration; the urllib one won't.  But none of that matters if the URLs are HTTP, so those should be disallowed during an automatic update.

Until they are, please disable auto_upgrade by default so that upgrading packages is an explicit decision made when the developer at least feels that their network connection is unlikely to be pwned.

RandomForrestClassifier for n_jobs != 1,"Hi,
I'm using a RandomForestClassifier with n_jobs =-1. I have also tried values != 1 with the same effect.
The problem is that python process gets replicated infinitely until the OS crashes. There are no loops in my code which reads like this:
1. init the RandomForest 
2. Load the data
3. Prepare the data
4. predictor.fit_transform(X,y) 
5. print some predictor parameters

It seems that all the processes start from very beginning and when they reach the 4th step...they replicate again. I end up soon having tens of processes running over and over again. 5th step never gets executed.
When I have set the n_jobs =1 everything works fine.

The code is exactly the same as on the site, I just renamed the class and the method called at load-time. The call actually looks like: detect::init();

"Chrome and Safari ""Pending Request""","So I'm having trouble using this. When ever I tell the script to load the file, it doesn't, it just creates a unknown ""pending"" request in Chrome and Safari. The weird thing is, is it works when running from chrome developer tools. I've also tried running it from an window load event listener, but it still doesn't work. Works fine in Firefox.

The code I'm using

``` js
var loader = new html5Preloader(file);
```

The result:

Feature request: loop option + chaining option,"Hi there.

I want to have a loop option, a Boolean, which indicate whether the animation will do the loop or not.

Why do I need this? For example, when I have only one blurb/text, I want the text to appear on my page with some sort of animation. So when the animation stops, I want the text to stay on the page with no more animation.

Another way is to implement onCycleEnd callback like the other request suggested, and stop the script using the method ""stop"". But I still want the option loop so I don't have to code anything :)

The second option I want is a chain option or something like that.
Example: 
I have a textualizer on top of the page and another at the bottom at the page. That makes 2. So when the 1st word of the 1st textualizer animated, the 1st one of the 2nd textualizer starts, and so on.

The logic is 1:1 -> 2:1 -> 1:2 -> 2:2...  

-> create 3 instances of textualizer
-> method chain (instance_1, instance_2, instance_3) to define the order of animation

ShareKit - E-mail compose view not being activated,"I hope its not inappropriate to post this question here, so if it is, just let me know.  I've posted this at StackExchange but have not gotten any input, so I am trying here.

I've implemented the following in a test app before incorporating it in a production app: 1. Launch UIImagePickerController from a button from a root view 2. Show an alert when the ""Use"" button is tapped in the image picker after a picture is taken 3. Give the user two alert buttons 1) to just save the image or 2) share it (via ShareKit) 4. Select E-mail from the ShareKit action sheet to send an e-mail with the image taken in the image picker (I'll implement other sharing services later.)

Everything works OK up to a point, i.e., the ShareKit action sheet is presented when I tap the alert view button with buttonIndex 1, I tap the e-mail selection and then the e-mail compose view appears with the image & title I specified, but the compose window is slightly greyed out & disabled, i.e., no actions (add a to addressee, enter body text, cancel, send) can be made and the app is stuck there.

I've tried adding [self dismissModalViewControllerAnimated:YES]; before the action sheet is presented, thinking that the modal image picker view is interfering with the modal mail composer view, but it makes no difference.

(If instead of calling the actionSheet I do [SHKMail shareItem:item]; (after adding #import SHKMail in the class) then I get a fully functioning mail compose window.)

Here's the relevant code:

```
- (void) alertView:(UIAlertView *)alert clickedButtonAtIndex:(NSInteger)buttonIndex
{
    if (buttonIndex == 0) {
         [alert dismissWithClickedButtonIndex:0 animated:YES];
        } 
     else if (buttonIndex == 1) {
         [self shareKitButtonHandlerAction];
         }  
}

- (void)shareKitButtonHandlerAction
{
    // Create the item to share
    NSData *imageData = [NSData dataWithData:UIImageJPEGRepresentation(imageToSend, 1.0)];
    SHKItem *item = [SHKItem file:imageData filename:@""Photo.jpg"" mimeType:@""image/jpg"" title:@""Photo""];

    // Get the ShareKit action sheet
    SHKActionSheet *actionSheet = [SHKActionSheet actionSheetForItem:item];

    // ShareKit detects top view controller (the one intended to present ShareKit UI) automatically,
    // but sometimes it may not find one. To be safe, set it explicitly

    [SHK setRootViewController:self];

    // Display the action sheet
    [actionSheet showInView:self.view];
    //[SHKMail shareItem:item];

}
```

0.3 Release,"I think we should try to get a 0.3 release finalised for the end of this week. Since 0.2 we've had a number of significant changes to the project including cleanups, tweaks, the boilerplate, a todo specification and new apps such as the Dojo example.

I really wanted to get https://github.com/addyosmani/todomvc/pull/59 sorted out too, but I'm not sure we'll have time. I might try getting this finished myself during the week. 

Some tasks related to a release are:
- Update https://github.com/addyosmani/addyosmani.github.com/tree/master/todomvc to reflect the new apps. Also revise the page language a little to better match the project README (e.g moving towards referring to apps as using the MV\* pattern over MVC as this is more accurate)
- Tag the release on Friday (and update any download links above)

Other than these items is there anything else you think we should be covering for 0.3? (this will be the last major release before the application rewrites for 1.0)

trying to set up nodester: user document/database,"Hello, I am trying to deploy nodester on my local machine, so far I have succeeded in making the proxy respond to the addresses I specified in config.js, and I have reconfigured nodester-cli to talk to my local instance, so that `nodester user register CouponCode` apparently succeeds.  However no user is created, from the looks of couchdb... there doesn't even appear to be a table to create them into.

Only nodester_coupons, which I guess is working, even if there's only room for one coupon code in this version.  Also the other databases that were named in example_config.js

That is as far as I can get without diving into more code, which I will probably do next.  I haven't really found the slightest clue how to install `nodester-admin`, all I found is that I need to make `admin.nodester.com` an entry in `/etc/hosts` or change the string in a bunch of places in HTML files and one javascript file where the redirect is declared.  Also that it can't be installed by a regular user in the ""admin"" slot.  Maybe I could install it with an app name of my own, and move it... except for the fact that

Login fails.  The couponcode register passes with no error that I can detect, and I can't guess where to look for it, if the result of that might have been written somewhere.  I would create the user document myself in couchdb, and just move past, but not sure what it should look like.  That is probably the easiest thing for me to figure out for myself.  I don't think it's necessary to use the admin app, if you can just get past `nodester user setup`.  It would be nice to have the whole shebang deployable as git submodules...

I would like to take a stab at updating your documentation, if you will help me deploy on my own machine!

Thanks,
Kingdon
