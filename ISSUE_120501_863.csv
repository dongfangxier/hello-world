REST discrepancy between PUT and Resource.save(),"Basically, basing on various REST resources (linked further down), we're not really doing it RESTfully.

`PUT` shouldn't be used for performing update operations (at least, not in the way `resourceful` does it - it merges updates with the existing document).

`PUT` to `/creatures/someId` should result in:
- creation of `/creatures/someId` if it doesn't exist, with data supplied in the request
- full replacement of `/creatures/someId` if it exists

I believe we could also use `PATCH` HTTP method for performing partial updates, but it introduces some risks related to concurrency.

A workaround might be this solution (not that user friendly like Flash-based solutions but more portable and security-aware):
Step 1: See http://stackoverflow.com/a/6055620 (to copy the password to the clipboard)
Step 2: javascript-based countdown after which a second window will be opened (like in Step 1) which allows ""overwriting"" of the clipboard with some dummy text.

  - compress the session before encrypting it (optional, will skip
    compression if it actually makes it larger)
  - use AES 128 CBC (AES 256 is actually _weaker_, due to a known
    attack on it), which also reduces the cookie size due to a smaller
    IV and less padding

    is now a part of the base64 encoding)

Create models from existing schema,"As soon as I get the MySQL SQL scripts that create the schema, I will post the link to them.

There are a few basic approaches:
1. Migrate the schema to one that is rails-conformant, naming-wise for columns and tables
2. You can setup your model classes with custom table-names and column-names to go with the existing scheme
3. You could use views to make the underlying tables more conformant.  I've used views with rails before and it's a pain to recreate the views whenever schema changes to the underlying tables occur so I wouldn't really recommend that if it's avoidable
4. You could build a new schema from scratch and pull over functionality to the rails app piecemeal, using a bridge to talk to the old app where necessary.  That's a good approach if it is impossible to do a greenfield app because you need the system to be up.  It also reduces risk but at the cost of extra development time and complexity.

The one part that I'd definitely recommend migrating is the primary key.  You want an autoincrement (or similar) id column.  Name could be something other than ID if necessary.  If the legacy schema uses composite keys you'd be highly advised to move away from that.

If there is not a huge # of tables I'd also recommend migrating most of it.

Expose libexec option in simple build system,"(Imported from [Trac #717](http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/hackage/ticket/717), reported by guest on 2010-07-23)

For my Bluetile Cabal package (
[http://hackage.haskell.org/package/bluetile](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/bluetile) ) I would like to install some of the executables into the libexec target directory.

Cabal already supports a libexec directory, there is just no easy way to get an executable copied there. So I had to write my own custom hooks.

To simplify things, I would like to suggest the option of marking an executable to be installed in the libexec directory. I propose a simple flag 'Is-Helper-Executable: True/False' which could be specified as part of an 'Executable' section. Setting this to True should result in Cabal installing the executable to the libexec directory.

Quick example of why one wants to use the libexec directory in the first place: Bluetile has a number of such helper applications. While having Bluetile packaged for Debian, it turned out that Debian requires a man page for every binary under /usr/bin. So I would have had to write man pages for every helper application or - which seemed like the proper way to do it - have them installed under /usr/lib/bluetile/ (libexec directory).

OpenID extension does not work with Google App Engine,"Following the instructions at http://wiki.restlet.org/docs_2.1/13-restlet/28-restlet/404-restlet.html will eventually lead to the error message: ""javax.net.ssl.KeyManagerFactory is a restricted class. Please see the Google  App Engine developer's guide for more details"".

As documented at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6977201/how-to-make-an-https-call-on-app-engine the core problem is that openid4java relies upon Apache's HTTPClient, which is not supported by Google App Engine.  

http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=6608 is a request for the GAE folks to allow KeyManagerFactory.

In the opeid4java project, issue 111 is quite similar to this (if not exactly the same).  Also, there is a claim at https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!searchin/openid4java/appengine/openid4java/h1tbZXZ4P6Y/v4JbMoX5msoJ that someone has produced a new openid4java jar that will work with GAE.

And finally, https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/openid4java/QoWd0YoVUo8 describes a workaround that I (a novice) was able to follow to create an openid4java jar that works with GAE (although it's probably a bit of a hack).

Consider Thrust Numeric library,"maximum & minimum & absolute_value et al don't belong in thrust/functional.h but they are useful because algorithms can't take fcn ptrs yet

Thrust vectors should always fire constructors but a vector of numeric types shouldn't for performance reasons - numeric_vector needn't

Thrust should have mathematical vector types that actually work with extra goodness like a tuple interface

valarray is < because it doesn't do fusion, but it would be trivial to get something even better with a numeric_range template with math ops defined for it

All this stuff could go into a numeric sub-library

If we make vector more conforming [1], we ought to be able to enable users to implement uninitialized vectors themselves.

As a side effect, cusp data structures won't need to unsafely implement themselves via thrust::detail::vector_base.

AFAICT there's no prior art within Thrust (in the public interface).  Internally we used Option 1 for merge_by_key, but I didn't give it much consideration back when.

Implement a good commit message writing text box,"See this StackOverflow question: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10565271/enhancing-the-wpf-textbox-with-long-line-markers

We want the first line to be max 50 characters long, and following lines to be max 72 characters long. Future versions will allow you to customize these. By no means should the user be forced to have line breaks, because:

> Some things should not be word-wrapped. They may be some kind of
> quoted text - long compiler error messages, oops reports, whatever.
> Things that have a certain specific format.

We could warn the user if he exceeds the character limit and presses commit (with a warning dialog along with a ""never display this again"").

Display a line marker to let the user know. Add tooltips for the line markers so the user knows what they are for.

Enlarge the commit text box when it receives focus, and make it back to its smaller size after it loses the focus. It should vertically take the whole space by hiding the diff panel below it. Horizontally it should make the status grid smaller and possibly it could temporarily hide Size and Binary columns of that grid.

Consider using a fixed-width font.

Add support for auto completion (like the filenames in the status grid).

FormRichLabelField does not have a visual editor,"When adding a `Rich Label Field` (via the ""add new"" dropdown menu)  the label body is shown as a plain text field with text-format html. there is no visual editor.

according to the doucmentation (http://www.hasecke.com/plone-benutzerhandbuch/4.0/erweiterungen/ploneformgen/gliederungselemente.html#formatierter-text) this type of field should render a visual editor in edit mode so users can easily provide images, links  within a form...

Setting Domain For Bonjour,"Hey,

I've found (_using the iOS example_) that setting the **domain** to anything other than `local.` causes the Bonjour service to fail to  publish.

It also seems that

`- (void)netService:(NSNetService *)ns didNotPublish:(NSDictionary *)errorDict` 

is never called so I'm unable to inspect `errorDict`.

Any ideas?

Request for support on indentation,"Hi,

In our company we have relatively strict guidelines on Lua code formatting and several hundreds KLOC of existing code that follows them (so changing guidelines is not a good idea). I wonder, is lua-mode configurable to match our rules, or is it hard to be made flexible enough to be configurable. 

You may find a bunch of code written according to our guidelines, for example, here: https://github.com/lua-nucleo/lua-nucleo/tree/master/lua-nucleo/. I believe that this indentation style is (mostly) not that uncommon.

Indentation rules in short:
- tabs to spaces;
- indent 2 spaces;
- 80 chars max line width;
- multi-line function arguments to be indented with two indents, closing parenthesis — with one (this, probably, is the uncommon part).

As an illustration, I prepared a naïve set of code (most likely incomplete, but will do as a start; if something more significant will be needed, I'll de-indent, say, a bunch of lua-nucleo files, that should cover most of the rules):

https://gist.github.com/37855303239506a16731

There is input, as typed (pasting it in console emacs works for me), expected output, and actual output with current lua-mode Git HEAD.

Unfortunately, we do not have any elisp gurus in-house, so we can't fix the problem ourselves. So I'm humbly asking for assistance. If this is something that is too large to be handled along the ""public support"" lines, I'll be happy to discuss sponshorship of one kind or another privately, please poke me via GH message.

Please note that we're not asking for a custom implementation of indentation code, but merely for the possibility to configure lua-mode to match our preferences.

Thank you in advance,
Alexander.

P.S. There was an year-old discussion on SO on that matter:

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4643206/how-to-configure-indentation-in-emacs-lua-mode

I don't speak elisp, so for me that discussion resulted mostly in cargo-cult programming, with little effect.

It seems to be a Magento bug, but I'm not sure since I'm not a PHP developer, it may only reflect Magento and PHP install on windows

modify this file

\app\code\core\Mage\Catalog\Model\Product\Api\V2.php
line 57-62

foreach ($filters->complex_filter as $_filter) {  
            $_value = $_filter->value;
            $preparedFilters[$_filter->key] = array(
                $_value->key => $_value->value
            );
        }
to

foreach ($filters->complex_filter as $_field => $_filter) {
            $preparedFilters[$_field] = array(
                    $_filter->key => $_filter->value
            );
        }
I also notice that in different V2.php file, this piece of code is written differently. The customer API is the same as product, but the order API is written like this

foreach ($filters->complex_filter as $_filter) {
            $_value = $_filter->value;
            if(is_object($_value)) {
                $preparedFilters[][$_filter->key] = array(
                    $_value->key => $_value->value
                );
            } elseif(is_array($_value)) {
                $preparedFilters[][$_filter->key] = array(
                    $_value['key'] => $_value['value']
                );
            } else {
                $preparedFilters[][$_filter->key] = $_value;
            }
        }
anyone can point out the correct array usage in PHP?

You will need to tweak it a bit for your purposes. In any case, this works well on gnome 2 & 3 and KDE on Linux. However, it still doesn't play well with Ubuntu's Unity environment. No idea how to fix it. I'm thinking there's a bug in Unity somewhere.

Why is Mage_Persistent breaking /api/wsdl?soap,"I get the following error within Magento CE 1.6.1.0

Warning: session_start() [<a href='function.session-start'>function.session-start</a>]: Cannot send session cookie - headers already sent by (output started at /home/dev/env/var/www/user/dev/wdcastaging/lib/Zend/Controller/Response/Abstract.php:586) in /home/dev/env/var/www/user/dev/wdcastaging/app/code/core/Mage/Core/Model/Session/Abstract/Varien.php on line 119

when accessing /api/soap/?wsdl

Apparently, a session_start() is being attempted after the entire contents of the WSDL file have already been output, resulting in the error.

Why is magento attempting to start a session after outputting all the datums? I'm glad you asked. So it looks like controller_front_send_response_after is being hooked by Mage_Persistent in order to call synchronizePersistentInfo(), which in turn ends up getting that session_start() to fire.

The interesting thing is that this wasn't always happening, initially the WSDL loaded just fine for me, initially I racked my brains to try and see what customization may have been made to our install to cause this, but the tracing I've done seems to indicate that this is all happening entirely inside of core.

We have also experienced a tiny bit of (completely unrelated) strangeness with Mage_Persistent which makes me a little more willing to throw my hands up at this point and SO it.

I've done a bit of searching on SO and have found some questions related to the whole ""headers already sent"" thing in general, but not this specific case.

Any thoughts?

Oh, and the temporary workaround I have in place is simply disabling Mage_Persistent via the persistent/options/enable config data. I also did a little bit of digging as to whether it might be possible to observe an event in order to disable this module only for the WSDL controller (since that seems to be the only one having problems), but it looks like that module relies exclusively on this config flag to determine it's enabled status.

UPDATE: Bug has been reported: http://www.magentocommerce.com/bug-tracking/issue?issue=13370

I'd report this is a bug to the Magento team. The Magento API controllers all route through standard Magento action controller objects, and all these objects inherit from the Mage_Api_Controller_Action class. This class has a preDispatch method

class Mage_Api_Controller_Action extends Mage_Core_Controller_Front_Action
{
    public function preDispatch()
    {
        $this->getLayout()->setArea('adminhtml');
        Mage::app()->setCurrentStore('admin');
        $this->setFlag('', self::FLAG_NO_START_SESSION, 1); // Do not start standart session
        parent::preDispatch();
        return $this;
    }
    //...
}
which includes setting a flag to ensure normal session handling doesn't start for API methods.

$this->setFlag('', self::FLAG_NO_START_SESSION, 1);
So, it sounds like there's code in synchronizePersistentInf that assumes the existence of a session object, and when it uses it the session is initialized, resulting in the error you've seen. Normally, this isn't a problem as every other controller has initialized a session at this point, but the API controllers explicitly turns it off.

As far as fixes go, your best bet (and probably the quick answer you'll get from Magento support) will be to disable the persistant cart feature for the default configuration setting, but then enable it for specific stores that need it. This will let carts

Coming up with a fix on your own is going to be uncharted territory, and I can't think of a way to do it that isn't terribly hacky/unstable. The most straight forward way would be a class rewrite on the synchronizePersistentInf that calls it's parent method unless you've detected this is an API request.

Bad system call: 12,"Hiyas

I have a very strange issue using a real framework (years later, how can I find out whether the framework was created as real or fake framework anyways?) on a device only. It works perfectly in the simulator but also when I debug directly on the device, it works flawlessly as well.
It only appears when deploying an app using the AppStore or TestFlight. I narrowed it down (so far) to simple C functions. First I thought it happened only with static C functions, but it looks like it also happens with normal C functions as well. When it happens the app simply crashes with a strange ""Bad system call: 12"" in the console. 
For example, when using the SSToolkit and moving that into a separate framework, the app using an SSGradientView will crash as soon as the C functions in CCGradientView.m are called.

I found a question on Stackoverflow where a guy apparently had a very similar problem, but could solve it by using no static C functions. In my case there aren't any C functions at all though. Is there maybe already a solution for this that I missed?

Marton wrote:
Nice. I am reading your code now. In my modifications to luabridge (internal unfortunately) I have had some of the same ideas as you did. For example, to key metatables using process-wide unique ids, only that mine are generated via

``` c++
template <typename T>
inline void* class_id()
{
    struct x {};
    return (void*) typeid(x).hash_code();
};
```

But `hash_code` needs C++11. Your solution might be easier on memory, since `typeid()` generates a string internally, however, I don't know if it's not optimized away. Also, to get the ID of a `const T`, I simply use `class_id(const T)`.

Also me I put the const methods additionally into the non-const metatable to save one lookup.

If I'm not mistaken, you also implemented the change I did too, to leave a class and its metatables on stack when registering its methods, to avoid looking it up every time.

Additionally to your changes, I got rid of all closures when pushing the proxies and to calculate the class uid inside the proxies on the fly. It might be faster (haven't benchmarked it though) and for sure it simplifies code.

The whole thing behaves slightly differently depending on the LANG env. variable, e.g. LANG=en_GB.UTF-8 vs. LANG=C

Same problem happens also with customizer data file as reported in #2453.

uno.RuntimeException: Binary URP bridge disposed during call,"Hi,

I installed editors/openoffice-3 from the FreeBSD ports (Apache OpenOffice 3.4), under a recent FreeBSD-9 (Stable).

The path for pyuno.so:
/usr/local/openoffice-3.4.0/openoffice.org/basis3.4/program/pyuno.so

unoconv does not work yet.

I tried the tarball for unoconv-0.4. First I had to add in the extrapath glob.glob('/usr/local/openoffice*/openoffice.org/basis*/program')

After that it comes up with

~/unoconv-0.4/unoconv -f pdf -o ~/test.pdf ~/test.odt 
Traceback (most recent call last):

  File ""/usr/local/lib/python2.7/UserDict.py"", line 23, in **getitem**
    raise KeyError(key)
KeyError: 'LD_LIBRARY_PATH'

LD_LIBRARY_PATH isn't set.

Anyway, I tried to use the latest version checked out via Subversion.

~/svn/unoconv/trunk]//unoconv -f pdf -o ~/test.pdf ~/test.odt 
unoconv: Cannot find a suitable office installation on your system.
ERROR: Please locate your office installation and send your feedback to:
       http://github.com/dagwieers/unoconv/issues

I wasn't successful with the extrapath addition as I did on unoconv-04. The error stays the same (Cannot find a suitable office..)

As a side node, I replaced ""#!/usr/bin/python"" with ""#!/usr/bin/env python"" (FreeBSD installs it under /usr/local/bin).

OpenOffice 3.4 and python 2.7 are compiled at the same time (same ports snapshot from last Friday, same gcc etc.) so python and pyuno.so should fit together.

Any ideas?

Select From List RegExp,"The app I'm currently testing contains a number of select controls that contain dynamic values. As the 'select from list' keyword does not allow for regular expressions, I need a new library keyword to allow selection bases on a regexp pattern. I've had a quick stab at this myself, and added the following code to my _selectelement.py. However, I don't know Python and I'm sure someone who does could do a much more elegant job. 

import re

def select_from_list_regexp(self, locator, regexp):

```
    select, options = self._get_select_list_options(locator)
    option_labels = self._get_labels_for_options(options)

    i = -1
    option_index = None
    found = False
    for label in option_labels:
        i+=1
        if re.search(regexp, label):
            option_index = i
            self._info(""Match for regexp '%s': label='%s'; index=%s"" % (regexp, label, i))
            found = True
            break

    if not found:
           self._info(""Failed to find a match for regular expression '%s' in list %s."" % (regexp, locator))

    self._select_option_from_single_select_list(select, options, option_index) 
```

This code seems to work ok, but it doesn't allow for multiple items or for the selection of the nth match of an expression. Perhaps this could be implemented in the next release of the library?

Cheers,

f:ajax exeucte always sends all the fields of the wrapping form,"f:ajax doesn't obey the 'execute' attribute but always sends all the fields in a form. Mojarra does, however, only process the listed fields as supposed. However, excess fields shouldn't be sent because it increases request size.

Recplicate with:

<h:form id=""form1"">
<h:commandButton>
<h:inputText id=""field1"" />
<h:inputText id=""field1x"" />
<f:ajax execute=""field1"" />
</h:commandButton>

On button click, both fields are sent (but only field1 would be processed).

Enable Windows users with SSH installed to use 'vagrant ssh',"Hello Mitchell,

I think vagrant is awesome, thank you.

I use vagrant on Windows and discovered that 'vagrant ssh' just leads to an error message that says 'use putty'. But I already have ssh on my system because it is included with git (and cygwin, and mingw). So I changed the vagrant code so that it works more like the *nix version and uses ""which"" to discover whether ssh is already installed. This required that I write a platform independent ""which"" function in Ruby and some unit tests. And I tested it on Windows and Linux (Ubuntu Lucid).

I hope you like it; please let me know if there's anything you'd like me to change and I will gladly do so.

Best,
## Pat

Cancelling pip install when package unpacked but not installed can give confusing error message,"I'm using pip to install a requirements.txt file in a virtualenv on a server. During the install, I think that I should have updated my requirements.txt file, so I hit Ctrl+C, do a pip freeze, and then restart the pip install.

Source in .../build/Django has version 1.2.3 that conflicts with Django==1.2.4 (from -r requirements/apps.txt (line 3))

It took me a couple minutes to figure out that the already downloaded and unpacked (but not installed) old version was confusing pip. I deleted the ""build"" directory and restarted the install, and everything worked this time. But it'd be nicer if pip wasn't confused by the presence of the old version in the build directory.

I think based on the code I see I would basically use ShaderMaterial for my material and then make some new kind of Geometry? CustomGeometry? WebGLCustomGeometry?

I guess the question then it should it have a say a ""draw"" function that WebGLRenderer calls or should it setup some map of attributes/buffers/offsets/strides to allow WebGLRenderer to do he setup?

Or something else?

FEATURE: Ability to inject scripts/resources before/after another resource in the page flow,"_**[james.m....@gmail.com](http://code.google.com/u/101963681963300214110/) commented:**_

> I would like the ability to inject a resource (typically a script) at a particular point in the page flow in order to enable me to instrument. However:
> - onPageInitialized fires before the script my instrumentation depends on (e.g. &quot;qunit.js&quot;) has been loaded
> - both injectJs and includeJs add scripts to the bottom of the page and/or after the page has already fully loaded
> 
> For example, if I wanted to add instrumentation (specifically for reporting with PhantomJS) before I execute my QUnit tests:
>     &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;/js/qunit.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
>     **\* INJECT INSTRUMENTATION SCRIPT HERE ***
>     &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;/js/runMyQunitTests.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
> 
> I could theoretically modify a request URL during a &quot;page.onResourceRequested&quot; handler to point to a different resource but that means I'd have to have some sort of mechanism for bundled my instrumentation plus whatever resource I actually wanted (assuming that resource is also JavaScript, as I can't add my JS to an CSS/image/etc. file).
> 
> I'm curious if it would be possible to implement this now (again, only for JavaScript resource requests) by altering the incoming request URL to be a Data URI instead? For example:
> 
> page.onResourceRequested = function(request) {
>     if (request.url.indexOf(&quot;/js/qunit.js&quot;) &gt; -1) {
>         var fs = require(&quot;fs&quot;),
>             dataUrlPrefix = &quot;data:text/javascript;charset=utf-8,&quot;,
>             dataRequested = fs.read(&quot;/js/qunit.js&quot;),
>             dataAfter = fs.read(&quot;/js/phantom-qunit.js&quot;);
>         request.url = dataUrlPrefix + dataRequested + dataAfter;
>     }
> };
> 
> As you can see, the above depends on me reading the requested file from the filesystem myself as PhantomJS can't synchronously download files from the web [that I'm aware of]. This may rarely be the actual situation, so this isn't very ideal either.
> 
> Alternatively, if we had access to the resource response body [related issue: http://code.google.com/p/phantomjs/issues/detail?id=158 ], you could potentially alter it much more easily that way without needing the actual requested resource present on the local filesystem (as in the above example). For example:
> 
> page.onResourceReceived = function(response) {
>     if (response.url.indexOf(&quot;qunit.js&quot;) &gt; -1) {
>         var fs = require(&quot;fs&quot;),
>             rawScript = fs.read(&quot;/js/phantom-qunit.js&quot;);
>         response.text += &quot;document.write('&lt;script&gt;' + rawScript + '&lt;/script&gt;');
>     }
> };
> 
> All that said, I feel like this functionality is worthy of an actual API as well... I'm just not sure what it would be. Perhaps it's not feasible given the asynchronous nature of the resource loading, though.

A page display 2 dropdown boxes, each of them contained over 100 values. There are two problems:
1. Render JSP is slow, over 2 seconds to display a simple page.
2. After running for a few days, the response time is slower, over 5 seconds to display the same page.

Verify GC log in Tomcat, there is no memory leak.
Is there any problem in OptionTag.renderOption method?

From other forumn, it also mentioned <form:select> has performance issue.

Prevent photoswipe from ever hiding the toolbar,"Even I set up

Could you please add new feature to the code preventing photoswipe from ever hiding the toolbar?

P.S.

I found lifehack solution to prevent hiding via css:

```
.ps-caption{
    opacity:0.8 !important;
    display:block !important;
}

.ps-toolbar{
    opacity:0.8 !important;
    display:table !important;
}   
```

but there should be a way doing it programmically.

How to combine Weighted Search & Association Search,"Weghted Search and Search through Associations works separately, but I was wondering how I could combine them. So I want to add the associative search as one of the weighted params.

Currently, I have 

```
class Mission < ActiveRecord::Base
  include PgSearch
  pg_search_scope :search_by_weight, :against => {:title => 'B', :content => 'C'}, :using => [:tsearch] #, :trigram, :dmetaphone]
  pg_search_scope :search_by_tag, :associated_against => {
   :tags => [:name]
  }
```

How would I incorporate the search_by_tag as one of the weights 'A'?

Dynamically add images to gallery while fancybox is open,"Hi

I am using fancybox on a website where I have 9 thumbnails of images. They are all in the same fancybox gallery and everything works just fine. Now if the user scrolls to the bottom of the page 9 more images are added dynamically. If this happens before the user opens the fancybox gallery everything works fine and all 18 images are displayed in a fancybox gallery. The thing that I am trying to achieve is that when the user opens the fancybox gallery and clicks on the last image thumbnail, the other images are added dynamically to the fancybox gallery. 

Is it possible to update the array of elements/images fancybox is displaying while fancybox is running? I looked at the fancybox source but couldn't figure out where and how the elements which should appear next are stored.

Thanks for your good work and I hope someone can help me out with this.

Added Output Buffering,"Hi,

So currently, if I have something like this:

```
Route::get('/', function()
{
    echo 'First';

    return Redirect::to('second');
});

Route::get('second', function()
{
    return 'Second';
});
```

The redirect never happens and I just get an empty response. That's because Laravel isn't utilising output buffering. I have added output buffering, which means you can echo anything, set session values or whatever then return an object that's an instance of Laravel\Redirect, and the redirect will happen.

of child nodes (and each child node can follow the same rules). I think I have the child
node thing solved, but what about collecting all of the attributes?

Flexslider 2 flickering between slides on Chrome OS X,"I'm on OS X 10.7.4 with Chrome 18.0.1025.168. With a basic flexslider setup, and with a ""fade"" animation, there is flickering between slides. You can briefly see the image behind it. In the latest Safari (Version 5.1.7)  however there is no flickering, and neither in FF 12. Strange, since chrome and safari are both webkit.

Also I should note that in Chrome Canary (20.0.1133.0) There is no flickering so could quite possibly be a bug within the current Chrome for Mac. I haven't tested on Windows.

"Facebook ""An active token must be used"" error [0.7.1]","I was successfully using 0.0.3 to access facebook and I'm trying to upgrade to 0.7.1. I've followed the example quite closely and read through the issues but always run into the error:

`An active access token must be used to query information about the current user.`

I'm not sure if that means I'm somehow not using an access token, or that my access token is not ""active"".

Here is the code I am using:

```
# create client
client = OAuth2::Client.new(APP_ID, APP_SECRET, :site => BASE_URL, :token_url => '/oauth/access_token')

# get auth url
client.auth_code.authorize_url(:redirect_uri => CALLBACK_URI)

# create token
token = client.auth_code.get_token(params[:code], :redirect_uri => CALLBACK_URI)

# attempt get
token.get('/me') # => ""An active access token must be used to query information about the current user.""

```

Is there an obvious mistake I am making here?

AJAXing in mega menus doesn't work locally unless within same folder,"@LaurentGoderre The AJAXing in of the mega menus works great on a Web server but doesn't work locally in most cases. Here is what happens:

Web server:
- Relative URL: menu-eng.html, Result: Success
- Relative URL: includes/menu-eng.html, Result: Success
- Relative URL: ../includes/menu-eng.html, Result: Success

Local:
- Relative URL: menu-eng.html, Result: Success
- Relative URL: includes/menu-eng.html, Result: Success
- Relative URL: ../includes/menu-eng.html, Result: Silent error

So the AJAXing works for demos/index-eng.html locally but not for demos/tabs/tabs-eng.html. It works for both on a Web server.

Is there some way to make this work through relative URLs so it can be tested both locally and on the Web server without changing the URLs? If not, is there some reasonable workaround for making it work locally as well?

X-Forwarded-Proto not honored by glassfish,"I am using a reverse proxy configuration in Apache with mod_proxy_http. I set the X-Forwarded-Proto header to either ""http"" or ""https"" depending on how the client accessed Apache.

Glassfish ignores this header and uses the ""http"" protocol specified in the Apache ProxyPass statement when building URLs (I am using Jersey and UriBuilder to create the URLs).

I was moving over from Jetty where this is supported:

ntservice: code in Win32Service.onStart() callback fails to look up classes,"For a day or so I have been investigating a strange issue in Win32Service where onStart() gets called, we attempt to start our service but calls to ServiceLoader fail with mysterious ""not found"" errors which don't happen if you run the same executable directly.

```
private static class ServerService extends Win32Service {
    @Override
    public void onStart() {
        System.out.println(""Starting..."");
        System.out.println(""Providers:"");
        for (Bootstrap bootstrap : ServiceLoader.load(Bootstrap.class)) {
            System.out.println(bootstrap.getClass());
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void onStop() { 
        //...
    }
}
```

This will fail with:

```
java.util.ServiceConfigurationError: com.acme.bootstrap.Bootstrap: Provider com.acme.stuff.MonitoringBootstrap not found
    at java.util.ServiceLoader.fail(ServiceLoader.java:231)
    ...
```

The bizarre thing here is that Java is somehow finding the META-INF/services file indicating which class to use but then failing to find the class itself.

I notice that other projects like YAJSW appear to have avoided the issue by not actually starting the service from the onStart() callback, which feels like a dodge to me (why have a start service callback if you can't use it to start the service?)

I had a theory that perhaps the thread was ruined somehow by Windows when it called it back and tried spawning a new thread instead of doing the startup on the same thread, but this doesn't appear to help either. I'm guessing I will probably resort to the same workaround others used, where I do the startup outside the callback.

Fade effect not fluent,"When using the fade option (all speeds set to 500) in a gallery, I noticed that the fading works fine in Firefox and Chrome, but in IE9 and Safari (Win) the transformation is not fluent, but very shaky; in visible steps.

In all browsers, after click to the next image, at first the shade and title of the current image dissapear, then the fade-out fade-in of the image takes place, and after the next image has faded in, there is a delay of maybe half a second and then title and the shade appear, wich is not very nice to look at.

Also: in the old Fancybox, when there a next image has a different size, the border -including the shade!- resizes smooth. In Fancyapps it just fades with the image. Is it possible to get the -much smoother looking- resize effect in FancyApps?

Чтение команды из стандартного ввода,"1. Просить пользователя ввести 0 в конце команды — абсурд, миллионы программных продуктов в мире же как-то обходятся без этого. Ответ прост — в конце строки и так стоит символ конца строки 0xA (""\n"").
2. # define MAXBUFFERSIZE 80
   
   char buffer[MAXBUFFERSIZE]; /\* Буффер для команды _/
   char *buf = (char_)malloc(MAXBUFFERSIZE);
   
   Во-первых, тут явно что-то упущено. Сначала статически создается массив нужного размера (что логично, т. е. размер известен заранее. Но потом он не используется, а создается другой, уже динамически.
   
   Во-вторых, нельзя рассчитывать, что длина команды не превысит 80 символов.

Итого: нужно читать информацию со стандартного посимвольно, аккуратно дожидаясь ""\n"". Причем когда заполнишь всю уже выделенную память, ее размер нужно увеличить (realloc()). Обычно увеличивают каждый раз в два раза. Делать нужно примерно как здесь: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/314401/how-to-read-a-line-from-the-console-in-c

В принципе, для таких целей можно применять scanf с первым параметром ""%s"", но он умеет читать только заранее заданное количество байт (""%80s""), что нас не устраивает. В GNU-реализации есть специальный ""%as"", который выделит память за тебя, но это не универсально и не очень спортивно.

`man scanf`
«The  GNU  C library supports a nonstandard extension that causes the library to dynamically allocate a string of sufficient size for input strings for the %s and %a[range] conversion specifiers. To make use of this feature, specify a as a length modifier (thus %as or %a[range]).»

Feature: make it easier to override models,"I like idea that base models are implemented as abstract models allowing subclassing.

However, overriding is not so easy, because:
- concrete classes are defined in same module as abstract models (polluting db schema in case of subclassing, views use concrete classes, etc)
- some things included in abstract models,  should  be part of default concrete implementation instead (ie: button text, required login, publish attributes, ...)

I like IoC ideas discussed in this (question)[http://stackoverflow.com/q/9175244/238628], especially with defining concrete models in settings.py.

strange implicit resolution behavior,"i am using scala 2.10.0-snapshot dated (20120522) and have the following scala files:

this one defines the typeclass and a basic typeclass instance:
<pre>
package com.netgents.typeclass.hole

case class Rabbit

trait Hole[A] {
  def findHole(x: A): String
}

object Hole {
  def apply[A : Hole] = implicitly[Hole[A]]
  implicit val rabbitHoleInHole = new Hole[Rabbit] {
    def findHole(x: Rabbit) = ""Rabbit found the hole in Hole companion object""
  }
}
</pre>

this is the package object:
<pre>
package com.netgents.typeclass

package object hole {
  
  def findHole[A : Hole](x: A) = Hole[A].findHole(x)
  
  implicit val rabbitHoleInHolePackage = new Hole[Rabbit] {
    def findHole(x: Rabbit) = ""Rabbit found the hole in Hole package object""
  }
}
</pre>

and here is the test:
<pre>
package com.netgents.typeclass.hole

object Test extends App {
  
  implicit val rabbitHoleInOuterTest = new Hole[Rabbit] {
    def findHole(x: Rabbit) = ""Rabbit found the hole in outer Test object""
  }

  {
    implicit val rabbitHoleInInnerTest = new Hole[Rabbit] {
      def findHole(x: Rabbit) = ""Rabbit found the hole in inner Test object""
    }
  
    println(findHole(Rabbit()))
  }
}
</pre>

as you can see, Hole is a simple typeclass that defines a method of which a Rabbit is trying to find.  i am trying to figure out the implicit resolution rules on it.

- with all four typeclass instances uncommented, scalac complains about ambiguities on rabbitHoleInHolePackage and rabbitHoleInHole. (why?)

- if i commented out rabbitHoleInHole, scalac compiles and i get back ""Rabbit found the hole in Hole package object"". (shouldn't implicits in the local scope take precedence?)

- if i then commented out rabbitHoleInHolePackage, scalac complains about ambiguities on rabbitHoleInOuterTest and rabbitHoleInInnerTest. (why? in the article by eed3si9n, url listed below, he found implicits btw inner and outer scope can take different precedence.)

- if i then commentted out rabbitHoleInInnerTest, scalac compiles and i get back ""Rabbit found the hole in outer Test object"". 

as you can see, the above behaviors do not follow the rules i've read on implicit resolution at all.  and i've only described a fraction of combinations you can do on commenting/uncommenting out instances and most of them are very strange indeed.  and i haven't gotten into imports and subclasses yet.

Oddly, the exact same thing inside my Ruby 1.9.3-p0 still works fine -- same RDiscount version.  I did recently update my gemset for a different reason; I imagine that a bundle update or gem install forced a recompile, and now some C code or library is not doing what it's expected to, since the error message is not coming from Ruby source code but from somewhere low level.

Someone else is having this problem too: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10152053/wrong-argument-type-string-expected-array

UPDATE: I solved it by making a custom gemset using RVM and doing a clean bundle install. I'll leave this bug here (feel free to close it) for reference or in case something else comes up.

RIAP routing with ClientResource broken,"The second example in this answer doesn't work with Restlet 2.2 SNAPSHOT:

http://stackoverflow.com/a/6909186/377721

Routing with ClientResource seems to be broken (the other path through ClientDispatcher on the Component works).

It looks like the RiapClientHelper checks for an instance of the RiapServerHelper:

```
            if (RiapServerHelper.instance != null
                    && RiapServerHelper.instance.getContext() != null
                    && RiapServerHelper.instance.getContext()
                            .getClientDispatcher() != null) {
                RiapServerHelper.instance.getContext()
                        .getClientDispatcher().handle(request, response);
```

The RiapServerHelper only ever creates an instance if it's called with a Server:

```
public RiapServerHelper(Server server) {
    super(server);
    getProtocols().add(Protocol.RIAP);

    // Lazy initialization with double-check.
    if (server != null && RiapServerHelper.instance == null) {
        synchronized (this.getClass()) {
            if (RiapServerHelper.instance == null) {
                RiapServerHelper.instance = this;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Nobody is ever calling it with a Server, the Engine defaults to this:

```
public void registerDefaultConnectors() {
    getRegisteredClients().add(
            new org.restlet.engine.connector.HttpClientHelper(null));
    getRegisteredClients().add(
            new org.restlet.engine.local.ClapClientHelper(null));
    getRegisteredClients().add(
            new org.restlet.engine.local.RiapClientHelper(null));
    getRegisteredServers().add(
            new org.restlet.engine.local.RiapServerHelper(null));
    getRegisteredServers().add(
            new org.restlet.engine.connector.HttpServerHelper(null));
    getRegisteredClients().add(
            new org.restlet.engine.local.FileClientHelper(null));
    getRegisteredClients().add(
            new org.restlet.engine.local.ZipClientHelper(null));
}
```

I think RiapServerHelper doesn't actually need/have a server, so maybe there shouldn't be a null check for instance creation?

tailoring search in non-hash fragments,"Currently, when using pushstate,  window.location.search is unconditionally included in the fragment backbone uses for routing.

However, this does not always make sense.  Some query string parameters are irrelevant (a cache defeat parameter is a classic example of this).  Some web servers, by design, neglect query string parameters (django is a plausible example of this).

You could of course incorporate into all of your routes some kind of specification which lets you ignore irrelevant query string parameters.  But that's unnecessarily repetitive, quirky and difficult to maintain.

I currently think that my near future needs in this situation demands four kinds of options:

use search (backwards compatible with current implementation, so default behavior)

ignore search

respect only certain enumerated query string parameters (using standard http query string structure)

I am planning on implementing like the above right now, but I wanted to see if anyone else had any thoughts or suggestions relevant to this issue.  (Have I overlooked some important feature of backbone here?)

Missing best practices on Redis failure,"So This isn't really a bug ... but an issue seemed the best forum I could think of for this question. I posted this on stackoverflow at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10590038/githubs-redis-and-resque-failure-behavior the other day. From it I asked:

Anyone have any insight into how GitHub deals with the potential failure or temporary unavailability of a Redis server when using Resque?

There are others that seem to have put together semi-complicated solutions as a holdover for redis-cluster using zookeeper (see https://github.com/ryanlecompte/redis_failover and http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7759572/solutions-for-resque-failover-redis). Others seem to have 'poor mans failover' that switches the slave to the master on first sight of connectivity issues without coordination between redis clients (but this seems problematic in the temporary unavailability scenario).

The question: Has Defunkt ever talked about how GitHub handles Redis failure? Is there a best practice for failover that doesn't involve zookeeper?

The original post on resque states part of the rational for the selection of Redis was the master-slave capability of redis, but the post doesn't describe how GitHub leverages this since all workers need both read+write access to Redis (see https://github.com/blog/542-introducing-resque).

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10406597/any-way-to-do-an-asynchronous-put-with-astyanax-for-cassandra-or-hector

I saw the ChunkedExample that takes an InputStream, but I am receiving http requests chunk after chunk and as I receive them, I want to stream them into cassandra ""without"" waiting for a reply from cassandra until the very last byte and then check all responses to make sure the whole file succeeded in being written.

Also, then need an example on getting it back out.  It looks like you may have this streaming capability,, right?

Also, is there a forum for questions?  I am trying to build an ORM/indexing(albeit lucene indexing with solr/solandra) in one which actually has NamedQuery but with lucene/solr syntax on github right now and trying to find a way to add this file streaming capabiltiy which is a little outside the ORM......solr then avoids the whole reverse indexing hack which is kind of very custom.

missing initial popstate in Webkit,"I have a quite large js-app and want to use pjax. Works great except in Chrome/Safari.

From what I can tell Webkit has some kind of initial popstate that you catch and just ignore.
The problem is that it takes some time before pjax is loaded on my page and can listen to popstate. My guess it that it fires before pjax is loaded and therefore when a user clicks a link pjax asumes that it is the initial popstate (which its not) and therefore the back button wont work.

The variable initialPop is set to true when that happends.

It is not possible to have a value binding not update on change events,"I would like to have a form which doesn't update the model until the user submits it. They should also be able to cancel, and the form not submit. According to the documentation, I should be able to pass a `valueUpdate` parameter to the binding telling it what event(s) to listen to. Unfortunately, since 843420a6f80 it will listen to the change event even if I don't want it to.

You might say that this is terribly unfair, however it's not. We're running php 5.3.3. There's a deprecated option called 'magic_quotes_gpc' that's turned on by default in this version. It's gone in php 5.4 and above. What that means for you, is that when we upgrade php, you lose that protection. You need to fix your application to allow for this.

UISearchBar with contentInset breaks it's “autofocus”,"I have a UISearchBar inside of an AQGridView. Now the searchBar shall be hidden initially (as you see in the Music app for instance). As AQGridViews (or UIScrollViews) don't have a header view, I placed it -40 points outside of the AQGridView's frame and also set the contentInset to 40 points.

```
searchBar = [[UISearchBar alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0.f, -40.f, 320.f, 40.f)];
gridView.contentInset = UIEdgeInsetsMake(0.f, 40.f, 0.f, 0.f);
```

Now from the look and general behavior that pretty much does exactly what I want. The search bar is hidden, but I can scroll up to reveal it.

Now here's the thing:

When I touch on the searchBar to give it focus and enter some text everything works fine except when the searchBar is not entirely visible. In that case the UIScrollView tries to automatically scroll it to complete visibility. However, it scrolls in the wrong direction.

So when, say, 10 points on top of the search bar are hidden, the scroll view scrolls down instead of up. Actually the first time I click on the search bar, it scrolls 40 points up, just without any animation and a subtle delay (even on the simulator). All following times the described scrolling downwards happens.

There's also a stackoverflow thread on that topic where it's been suggested this is probably a bug in AQGridView. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10730431/uiscrollview-with-contentinset-breaks-uisearchbar-autofocus#comment13940021_10730431

Bug in autoload_paths?,"I am encountering a strange bug in my code. I have a rails application with the following two files in the lib:

lib/module_one/module_two/class_one.rb

``` ruby
    module ModuleOne
      module ModuleTwo
        class ClassOne
          class << self
            def test
              puts 'Class one'
              ClassTwo.test
            end
          end
        end
      end
    end
```

and

``` ruby
lib/module_one/module_two/class_two.rb

    module ModuleOne
      module ModuleTwo
        class ClassTwo
          def self.test
            puts 'Class two'
          end
        end
      end
    end
```

Now my problem is, that when I go into the console and write:

```
ModuleOne::ModuleTwo::ClassOne.test
```

it throws the following: `NameError: uninitialized constant ClassTwo`

The strange thing is, that the problem seems to be connected to the use of `class << self` instead of `self.method`. If I change the class_one.rb file like this it works!:

``` ruby
    module ModuleOne
      module ModuleTwo
        class ClassOne
          def self.test
            puts 'Class one'
            ClassTwo.test
          end
        end
      end
    end
```

Im loading the files in application.rb like this:

```
config.autoload_paths += %W(#{config.root}/lib)
```

Is this a bug in rails, or is it just me getting something all wrong?

Im using rails 3.1.3 btw

perhaps? This is not really an issue, it's just a cosmetic fix (`USER_APPS_DIR` points to `$HOME/Applications`), but the next one is. For the framework we get

```
INSTALL_PATH = ""$(LOCAL_LIBRARY_DIR)/Frameworks"";

and MacPorts or HomeBrew cannot compile without replacing the whole `""$(LOCAL_LIBRARY_DIR)/Frameworks""` part. I would suggest to replace the definition above with

```
LOCAL_FRAMEWORKS_DIR = ""$(LOCAL_LIBRARY_DIR)/Frameworks"";
INSTALL_PATH = ""$(LOCAL_FRAMEWORKS_DIR)"";
```

which makes it possibly to simply run

```
xcodebuild LOCAL_FRAMEWORKS_DIR=/opt/local/Library/Frameworks LOCAL_APPS_DIR=/Applications/MacPorts
```

as opposed to having to apply patches first.

Getting the number of days in the month,"Occasionally it is useful to know how many days there are in each month.  For example, if you have monthly readings of something (sales totals or electricity consumption or whatever), you might expect there to be less in February since the month is shorter.  In this case it can be useful to normalise the monthly readings by dividing by the number of days in that month.

Here's a suggested implementation

```
#' Get the number of days in the month of a date-time.
#' 
#' Date-time must be a POSIXct, POSIXlt, Date, chron, yearmon, yearqtr, 
#' zoo, zooreg, timeDate, xts, its, ti, jul, timeSeries, and fts objects.
#'
#' @param x a date-time object
#' @return An integer of the number of days in the month component of the date-time object.
days_in_month <- function(x)
{
  month_x <- month(x, label = TRUE)
  N_DAYS <- c(
    Jan = 31L, Feb = 28L, Mar = 31L, 
    Apr = 30L, May = 31L, Jun = 30L, 
    Jul = 31L, Aug = 31L, Sep = 30L, 
    Oct = 31L, Nov = 30L, Dec = 31L
  )
  n_days <- N_DAYS[month_x]
  n_days[month_x == ""Feb"" & leap_year(x)] <- 29L
  n_days
}
```

And some `testthat`-style tests.

```
context(""test days_in_month"")

test_that(
  ""days in month works for non leap years"",
  {
    x <- seq(ymd(""2011-01-01""), ymd(""2011-12-01""), ""1 month"")
    expected <- c(
      Jan = 31L, Feb = 28L, Mar = 31L, 
      Apr = 30L, May = 31L, Jun = 30L, 
      Jul = 31L, Aug = 31L, Sep = 30L, 
      Oct = 31L, Nov = 30L, Dec = 31L
    )
    expect_that(days_in_month(x), equals(expected))
  }
)

test_that(
  ""days in month works for leap years"",
  {
    x <- seq(ymd(""2012-01-01""), ymd(""2012-12-01""), ""1 month"")
    expected <- c(

Creating a menu item with a period in id name doesnt work,"If you create a menu item from an extension, and the ID for the menu item contains a period ("".""), then the menu items will be created, but the name will be an empty string.

        CommandManager.register(""Decode URI Component"", ""convert.decode_uri_component"", _convertToDecodeURIComponent)

```

I realize that this is because the id is being used as a dom id, but we should hide this implementation detail from developers.

It also appears that ""."" is a valid character for a dom id:

in HashedWheelTimer  we calculate the sleep time.

on windows we must take care:

for same reason we should add:

domReady firing to early on IE,"I'm running IE9 and the domReady plugin is firing early. 

I stepped through the code and tracked it down.

```
    //Check if document already complete, and if so, just trigger page load
    //listeners. Latest webkit browsers also use ""interactive"", and
    //will fire the onDOMContentLoaded before ""interactive"" but not after
    //entering ""interactive"" or ""complete"". More details:
    //http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/the-end.html#the-end
    //http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3665561/document-readystate-of-interactive-vs-ondomcontentloaded
    if (document.readyState === ""complete"" ||
        document.readyState === ""interactive"") {
        pageLoaded();
    }
```

For some reason IE9 is setting the readyState to interactive before it even parses the &lt;body&gt;. Here is what I found when I had a break point on pageLoaded();

```
window.document.getElementsByTagName('head') 
{
0 : {...},
length : 1,
item :  function item() {     [native code] } ,
namedItem :  function namedItem() {     [native code] } 
} 
```

So the document has a head at that point as it should.

```
window.document.getElementsByTagName('body') 
{
length : 0,
item :  function item() {     [native code] } ,
namedItem :  function namedItem() {     [native code] } 
} 
```

But the body doesn't even exist yet and it has the readyState === ""interactive""

This is an issue I ran into a long while ago. I originally submitted a pull request to add document.readyState === ""interactive"" as one of the valid readyStates. https://github.com/jrburke/requirejs/pull/137. I ran it in production for a while and would randomly see dom load errors on IE. This caused me to back it out. So I think we need to remove the readyState === ""interactive"" check.

Fix retina for iPad 3,"Current stable and nightly builds does not support retina display on iPad 3.
My guess is the current retina detection code is good, but to work it has to be built against iOS 5.1 SDK.

Two quick ideas of possible solutions :
1. Build against 5.1, and if not possible,

installations seems stuck = no progress bar update during unzip,"the installations seems stuck during unzip process. this is confusing for some users.

the reason is that innosetup executes an external unzip tool several times.
the status of the unzip tool (it's progess) is not available nor reported back 
to the innosetup installation wizard and so the progress bar is not updated.

this is an idea on how to solve this:
_TotalProgressBar_
count the unzip operations in total.
that would make progress bar segments (100/unzip ops).

_CurrentComponentProgessBar_
for each unzip op:  
a)exec unzip with showing progress on command line (parameter for percentage?)
b) simply write stdout to file
c) then innoscript use pascal to read the file and use the value to 
d) adjust a custom progress bar

eb_auth_tokens = { app_key:  'my-app-key',
                   user_key: 'my-user-key'}
eb_client = EventbriteClient.new(eb_auth_tokens)
response = eb_client.user_list_events()
## print response

I keep getting the following error.
## Also, i noticed I only get the error when there is some data to be returned. If for example there are no events being returned, then there would be no error.

stringPh falls in range of strEditedText.
Why is the text color not changing to blue for phonenumber?

Doubts / Questions,"Hey Mathew , 

I have some questions and as you are busy with Beta4 release of #ZF2 I thought of creating a issue .

1 ) Template Inheritance

I recently asked you whether mustache can do template inheritance as like Jinja . 
Question in stackoverflow with answer 

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7925931/can-mustache-templates-do-template-extension

But I was wondering whether its possible like 

base.html

```
<html><head></head>
    <body>
    {% block content %}{% endblock %}
    </body>
</html>
```

frontpage.html

```
{% extends ""base.html"" %}
{% block content %}<h1>Foobar!</h1>{% endblock %}
```

So we don't need to bother whether we placed it on the right place .

```
echo $mustache->render('layout', $view);
```

So in the render we don't need to set `layout` to be rendered , instead we set the `view name` and the view will extend the template .

2 ) Caching 

We are not setting the cache path, and wondering how the caching works 

https://github.com/weierophinney/phly_mustache#caching-tokens

I am not sure how I need to implement .

3 ) Security / Sandboxing

Is there a way that we can restrict / disable some functions doing sandbox before being rendered ?

Thanks

form fields are not working,"Good afternoon,

when i insert a form, the fields are not working, in terms of its there but its a sort of disabled. you can click it. i think because of a 'layer' is on top of it but im not sure what do about it and maybe i'm missing something...

for example:

```
            var defaultView = { title: ""Form field check"", 
                      view:  $('<div id=""defaultView""><input style=""z-index:999;"" type=""text"" class=""span3"" placeholder=""Email""></div>')
                            };


            //Setup the ViewNavigator
            new SplitViewNavigator( 'body', ""Menu"", ""btn primary"" );    
            window.splitViewNavigator.pushSidebarView( controller.rootView );
            window.splitViewNavigator.pushBodyView( defaultView );
```

inserts a input type text in the Bodyview and in my project the text field is not working in Desktop browsers and safari mobile. I already give it a z-index:999 and removed the jquery click on 'this.contentOverlay' for testing but that doesn't make any difference.

I also would like to help to improve the code base but as there is no manual i'm not sure if its really a bug or that its my code...

Would like to know how form elements behave on your side?

What could be the issue?

duplicatable module incorrect,"http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/Class.html#method-i-duplicable-3F

duplicable? for Class and Module is incorrect.

You can dup both, and get different objects, the example shown is misleading, as actually:

c = Class.new # => #Class:0x10328fd80
d = c.dup         # => #Class:0x10328fd80
c == d  #=> false

so d is actually a different object, even tho the .to_s showed something similar.  You can def methods or modify d without effecting c.  Perhaps this is just a ruby 1.9 thing, but it's not as specified now.

The same goes for module too.

I'm not sure whether Rails would go bang if we were duping classes because this was reporting the correct value.  The only time I do it, is to modify a class in a test, to test class methods etc, and ensure I don't lose original implementation..

How can I get access to the .ordinalize method?,"Hi folks,

just a quick question, I've been hunting around the web to find a way to basically generate `1st`, `2nd`, `3rd` and so on as part of a date string in MiddleMan 3 beta 2.

At the moment (this is giving me an error) I'm am trying to do:

``` ruby
date = Date.parse( lorem.date )

# then in my erb template:
<%= date.strftime(""#{date.day.ordinalize} %b, %Y"") %>
```

The error I'm getting is this `undefined method `ordinalize' for 5:Fixnum`

However every resource online (Stackoverflow posts, Ruby docs) seem to suggest that `.ordinalize` should be available in Rails and in Ruby via `require ""active_support""`.

In my `Gemfile` I have:

``` ruby
gem ""activesupport"", ""~> 3.2.3""
```

But that doesn't seem to do the trick either…

Any ideas on how to get access to this method would be much appreciated.

Thanks for reading.

Footer not fixed to bottom of screen in iOS 4.3,"Thanks for sharing your plugin!

I found your jQuery Mobile iScroll plugin while searching for a truly fixed header and footer bar.

Running your demo in iOS 4.3 shows a footer bar that is not attached to the bottom of the screen. (hovering half way)

In iOS 5+ it works beautifully.

The iScroll4 demo works on iOS 4.3.
I've tried making the footer absolutely positioned (as below).
Doesn't work -- the footer is absolutely positioned, but 20+ pixels off. 

``` css
.ui-footer {position:absolute !important;bottom:0px}

Adding byteoffset and line no. to callbacks.,"Hi Gabriel,

Thanks for this nice package.  I needed a way to get the byte offset of the line I was reading, so I wend ahead and added the byte offset to the callback for the 'byte', 'character', 'buffer', and 'line' events.  'line' event also gets the line no.

Sorry for the white-space mix up, I have it set to no-tabs.  If you do a 'git diff --ignore-all-space' you'll see just the changes.

Also I did a bit of optimization on the event callbacks.  Don't know if it makes much difference, but better to be on the safe side.  (I'm reading multi MB files).

Should probably add test cases if you decide to incorporate these.

Best,
moos

Better documentation ,"I was originally going to say ""better documentation for timeout / cache parameters"", but I really feel like this is a product-wide issue.

Going to the ""Store"" method's documentation (http://amplifyjs.com/api/store/), the entry for ""expires"" is 

> expires: Duration in milliseconds that the value should be cached

That's it!
#### Missing information:
1. What happens when it's undefined/null?
2. What is the maximum value?
3. What happens when it's negative?

There also seems to be no information on how to clear the entire cache or what happens when you do explicit storage usage and the browser doesn't support it.

I know there are forums where this information may be found, but someone should be updating the documentation with this information so we don't have the ""needle in the haystack"" approach to finding documentation (searching through forum posts)

If you set a listener on a property, and update that property SILENTLY, and then chain another set / unset on it, the silent is ignored and the event is triggered.

Rotate and position cylinders,"I'm having some issues regarding rotation of cylinders. I'm trying to rotate the cylinder localy in a loop using euler angles in the order='ZYX', but believe my issue is a result of the fact that the cylinder has the Y-axis as hight axis.

I've tried rotating the cylinder Pi/2 radians arround the X-axis before calling the rotateAndPlace() -function (shown below). But for some reason, the result is not as expected. 

All help is greatly appreciated!!

``` javascript
THREE.Object3D.prototype.rotateAndPlace = function( ) {

    this.eulerOrder = 'ZYX';

    for(c=0;c<3;c++){

        var yPos = parseFloat(position[c].childNodes[2].childNodes[0].nodeValue);
        var zPos = parseFloat(position[c].childNodes[3].childNodes[0].nodeValue);

        var xAng = parseFloat(orientation[c].childNodes[1].childNodes[0].nodeValue)*Math.PI/180;
        var yAng = parseFloat(orientation[c].childNodes[2].childNodes[0].nodeValue)*Math.PI/180;
        var zAng = parseFloat(orientation[c].childNodes[3].childNodes[0].nodeValue)*Math.PI/180;


        this.translateZ(zPos);

        this.translateX(xPos);

Do this:

1) In the AppDelegate.m, add:
[self.sampleDownloader useCache];

2) Run and click ""Download File"".

""Trying to insert nil value...""
I found out that the method -(void) enqueueOperation:(MKNetworkOperation_) operation forceReload:(BOOL) forceReload { in MKNetworkEngine is called. As [completedCacheableOperation responseData] in line 379 is nil, this will crash the app when it tries to write anything into cache (in -(void) saveCacheData:(NSData_) data forKey:(NSString*) cacheDataKey ).

The progress seems to ""progress"" fine, but the onCompletion:^(MKNetworkOperation completedRequest) is not being filled.

What's wrong? Or: What am I doing wrong? This is very basic functionality of MKNetworkKit....
Please help, I have a tight release deadline ahead of me!

It seeks to diminish or even abolish authority in the conduct of human relations. Anarchists may widely disagree on what additional criteria are required in anarchism. Oxford Companion to Philosophy says, ""there is no single defining position that all anarchists hold, and those considered anarchists at best share a certain family resemblance.""    481

Inappropriate assumption about the pointer address.,"This is minor case, but we care of this story.
In the embedded system what can use the memory space which begins from the address 0 as a usual data area exists.
It makes bugs sometimes.

See this code.

```
void *ptr = ptr_to_data_or_data_type;
intptr_t data_type = (intptr_t)ptr_to_data_or_data_type;
switch (data_type) {
case 0:
    do_something_0(ptr);
    break;
case 1:
    do_something_1(ptr);
    break;
}
```

This code can run normally, if 'ptr' is far from address 0 enough.
However, this assumption is out of place in a specific embedded system.

In src/parser.y: void parser_dump(...)

```
dump_prefix(offset);
n = (int)(intptr_t)tree->car;
tree = tree->cdr;
switch (n) {
```

This code has same problem.

Extremely slow performance on big table,"Hi I have a table that is 14,000,000 rows and I'm performing a between query.  It returns 5 rows.  This query takes .009 seconds  when I do the query myself.  It takes 30 seconds using this mysql library.

```
var mysql = require('mysql');
rows = 0;

var client = mysql.createClient({
    user: 'root',
    password: '',
});

client.typeCast = false;

client.query('USE mainDB');
var selectStart = +new Date;

function query() {
    client
    .query(""SELECT * FROM `pkg_load` WHERE ((`time_stamp` >= '2011-01-01 00:00:00') AND (`time_stamp` <= '2011-01-01 00:04:59')) "")
    .on('row',
    function(row) {
        rows++;
    })
    .on('end',
    function() {

        var duration = ( + new Date - selectStart) / 1000,
        rowsPerSecond = rows / duration;
        console.log('%d rows / second', rowsPerSecond.toFixed(2));
        console.log('%d ms', +new Date - selectStart);
        client.end();
    });
}

query();
```

Output

```
30039 ms
```

If if do a bench on a small table it's fine.  Any big table it's horrible performance.

If I run this same query in Java using JDBC Mysql driver it performs excellent.

Ownership management policies,"Hi Vinnie,

I think it makes sense to continue the discussion here.

Your suggestion to implement policies was the following:

> classname can be expanded to include a policy. Given:

``` c++
struct Policy
{
  virtual void push () = 0;
  virtual void addref () = 0;
  virtual void release () = 0;

  template <class PolicyType>
  static Policy* getPolicy ()
  {
    static PolicyType policy;
    return &policy;
  }
};
```

> We can add this:

``` c++
template <typename T>
struct classname
{
  static inline Policy& policy()
  {
     return *classname <T>::m_policy;
  }
  template <class PolicyType>
  static inline void set_policy ()
  {
    classname <T>::m_policy = &Policy::getPolicy <PolicyType> ();
  }

private:
  static PolicyType* m_policy;
};

template <typename T>
PolicyType* classname <T>::m_policy = Policy::getPolicy <DefaultPolicy> ();
```

> Then we expand class__ to include an additional PolicyType template parameter, and set the policy in the classname at the same time we associate the name with it:

``` c++
template <typename T, class PolicyType>
class__<T>::class__ (lua_State *L_, const char *name_): scope(L_, name_)
{
  assert(!classname<T>::is_const());
  classname<T>::set_name(name_);
  classname<T>::set_policy <typename PolicyType> ();

```

> Here are some examples of code using this scheme:

``` c++
s.class_ <test3> (""test3"").method (""f"", &test3::f); // default policy
s.class_ <test3, BoostSharedPtrPolicy> (""test3"").method (""f"", &test3::f); // use boost::shared_ptr
s.class_ <test3, CustomPolicy> (""test3"").method (""f"", &test3::f); // use domain specific policy
s.class_ <test3, ImmortalPolicy> (""test3"").method (""f"", &test3::f); // straight pointer with no ref count policy
```

Issue #141 - team 5,"A simple design for list of online users. I also added the toggle animation for hidding it and the title for this 'box' (Active Users or Logged in Users doesn't really sound good, but that's the least of my worries :)).

Also added the ability to display only users that contain the searched string and to arrange list of logged in users by alphabet(design needs to be improved). Also the true image of the user should be passed in 'data' to javascript. We (I and igypigi->did most of the javascript) were also unable to test this completely, because the updating logged in users doesn't always work(on our computers) and we weren't able to figure out why.
