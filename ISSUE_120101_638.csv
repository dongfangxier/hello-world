PostgreSQL (and any _real_ database heh heh) support multiple schemata per database, which can be used for namespacing without the overhead of multiple databases (or the loss of joining between them).

SQLAlchemy, though, just reads and loads into/from the default. Would be nice if that weren’t the case.

I sense this will be a gigantic headache, as the schema doesn’t appear anywhere within the database URL syntax, and I think you’ll need to specify the schema when running _any_ code that uses `pokedex`.

void clamp(SD& srcDst, float lowerBound, float upperBound) {

Copying the ParStream.scala sans scalax package line, it compiles fine with 2.9.1.final (I use Debian's scala packages), but attempting to use it with something like:

```
import ParStream._
val s=ParStream(Iterator.from(2),8)
ParStream(Iterator.from(2),8).map(x=>{println(x);x}).takeWhile(_<100)

seems to just result in the process hanging up (zero CPU, never outputs anything, never terminates).

Registration failure responses should be more easily differentiated,"Currently, two situations are covered by the same 400 status code registration response - that the email is invalid, and that the email is already in use. It is possible to differentiate between the situations by looking at the text in the ""email"" field of the response:

{""email"": [""Enter a valid e-mail address.""]}
{""email"": [""A user is registered with this e-mail address.""]}

However, checking for matches with that sort of specific natural language seems a poor and unreliable way for a client to determine what's going on, as the server may at some point in the future change a word or two.

It would be better to use different status codes for the different situations. One suggestion has been to use code 409 for the ""email already in use"" response. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3825990/http-response-code-for-post-when-resource-already-exists

Working with a proxy,"Hello,

I am exceptionally on a network that requires a proxy configuration.
I thought I would try out my email software on this network, and as it turns out the TcpClient object doesn't work on proxies and doesn't seem to allow any proxy configuration.

Have you used your library through a proxy ?

If not, i have found a quite simple open-source C# library creating TcpClient objects through proxies :
http://www.starksoft.com/prod_proxy.html

As an example, the connect method in Imap client could become something like :

public void Connect(string hostname, int port, bool ssl, string proxyHost = null, int proxyPort = -1, ProxyType proxyType = ProxyType.None) 
{
            try
            {
                Host = hostname;
                Port = port;
                Ssl = ssl;

```
            if (proxyHost != null && proxyType != ProxyType.None && proxyPort > -1)
            {
                // create an instance of the client proxy factory 
                ProxyClientFactory factory = new ProxyClientFactory();

                // use the proxy client factory to generically specify the type of proxy to create 
                // the proxy factory method CreateProxyClient returns an IProxyClient object 
                IProxyClient proxy = factory.CreateProxyClient(proxyType, proxyHost, proxyPort);

                // create a connection through the proxy to hostname over the port 
                _Connection = proxy.CreateConnection(hostname, port);
            }
            else { _Connection = new TcpClient(hostname, port); }


            _Stream = _Connection.GetStream();
            if (ssl)
            {
                var sslSream = new System.Net.Security.SslStream(_Stream);
                _Stream = sslSream;
                sslSream.AuthenticateAsClient(hostname);
            }

            _Reader = new StreamReader(_Stream, System.Text.Encoding.Default);
            string info = _Reader.ReadLine();
            OnConnected(info);

            IsConnected = true;
            Host = hostname;
        }
        catch (Exception)
        {
            IsConnected = false;
            throw;
        }
    }
```

and the imap constructor :

public ImapClient(string host, string username, string password, AuthMethods method = AuthMethods.Login, int port = 143, bool secure = false, string proxyHost = null, int proxyPort = -1, ProxyType proxyType = ProxyType.None) {
      Connect(host, port, secure, proxyHost, proxyPort, proxyType);
      AuthMethod = method;
      Login(username, password);
    }

the request method is HUGE, and while I only need to monkey patch a 
small part of the code, the size of the request method makes me have to

Support more than ISO-8859-1 (Latin-1),"Common request people make is for Trelby to support more than the ISO-8859-1 (also known as Latin-1) character set to write scripts in. We already support most Western European languages (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_8859-1 for the full list), but there are plenty of characters used in other languages not found in Latin-1.

Things that would need to be implemented to support arbitrary Unicode characters in scripts, ranked in decreasing order of difficulty:
- Unicode characters in PDF. Hard problem; PDF spec is oriented towards Latin-1 and basically says that to use anything else, you must embed your own font, subset the characters you use, and do complicated lookup tables to encode the text. That's how it was 5 years ago anyway when I last looked at it; maybe the spec has improved since then? See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/128162/unicode-in-pdf and http://blogs.adobe.com/insidepdf/2008/07/text_content_in_pdf_files.html for some discussions about this.
- Unicode font metrics for PDF output (fontinfo.py). Standard PDF fonts only have metrics available for Latin-1 characters; how do we generate PDF without knowing the sizes for characters we are using?
- Text input. Right now, OnKeyChar gets a key event and it contains an 8-bit character code. To support input of unicode characters, we need to do more. Maybe use the wxKeyEvent::GetUnicodeKey function? See http://docs.wxwidgets.org/2.8/wx_wxkeyevent.html. Note that Latin-1 characters are easy to input, they're a single keypress on most keyboards. Fancier unicode characters sometimes have very sophisticated input systems where people type in something, a popup shows up, they select the character they want, etc. I have no idea how those input systems integrate to wxWidgets, or if they do at all.
- All the text processing in Trelby would need to be redone to do it in Unicode instead. util.py has a whole bunch of string handling functions, for example.
- Probably more that I'm forgetting right now.

Can't set breakpoints in framework project,"Hi,

I'm not entirely sure if this is an issue with iOS-Universal-Framework or Xcode itself, but I'm having issues with a framework project I created using iOS-Universal-Framework. It's a fake framework and I'm using the normal `.framework` file. I have the framework project and my app project in a workspace and I set breakpoints in the framework project's code but GDB never breaks on them. If I manually add a breakpoint with, for instance, `SomeFile.m:123` then GDB tells me that it can't find the file called `SomeFile.m` so it looks like debug symbols are being stripped. I've checked and I definitely have the option for stripping debug symbols set to `NO` though.

Any thoughts on this issue or how to work around it?

Setup:
- Xcode 4.2.1
- iOS SDK 5.0

Error during build with group user,"Hi.
I discovered strange behavior while using Markdoc. I'm not expert on Unix system, but it makes me can't use Markdoc as I expected. Please read this issue and let me know what the problem is :(

I was trying to configure Markdoc to use with group account.
I configured Markdoc and set its repository being owned by a new user:group `markdoc:markdoc`.
I pushed all users who will use Markdoc into `markdoc` group. And last, I set the repository directory permission like this.

```
find . -type d -exec chmod ug+wrxs {} \;  
find . -type f -exec chmod ug+wr-xs {} \;
```

It worked properly, before I run `markdoc build` with other user account rather than `markdoc` itself.

Allow overriding @ActiveProfiles in test classes with system property [SPR-8982],"**[Alex](https://jira.spring.io/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=verdyan)** opened **[SPR-8982](https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-8982?redirect=false)** and commented

#### Status Quo

Support for setting the _active_ bean definition profiles in an integration test within the Spring TestContext Framework (TCF) is currently limited to one of the following techniques:

1. Providing a hard-coded list of profiles declared via the `value` or `profiles` attribute of `@ActiveProfiles`   - since Spring Framework 3.1
2. Specifying a custom `ActiveProfilesResolver` (which programmatically determines the active profiles) declared via the `resolver` attribute of `@ActiveProfiles`   - since Spring Framework 4.0

In stand-alone or production code, Spring honors the `spring.profiles.active` system property for determining the set of active profiles to use when loading an `ApplicationContext`; however, the TCF _ignores_ this system property, relying solely on configuration via `@ActiveProfiles`.

---

#### Proposals

1. Provide the ability to override `@ActiveProfiles` specified in an integration test via the `spring.profiles.active` system property or some other system property specific to the TCF.
2. Set the `spring.profiles.active` system property to the value specified via `@ActiveProfiles`
   - See comments in this issue for background.
   - This point likely warrants its own JIRA issue for proper consideration.

---

#### Implementation Notes

- Consider introducing a new `boolean` flag in `@ActiveProfiles` that allows profiles declared via the annotation to be overridden by those defined via the `spring.profiles.active` system property (if it is present).

Blinking caret/cursor doesn't scroll with it's Input text form element ,"HI

I've been using iscroll on our mobile pages from last six months and it was working fine even with form element hack. But suddenly now on iPhone, we have came across an issue with iscroll. 

The scrollWrapper has 5-6 diff form elements. Click on one of the  text input box, it gets focus and virtual keypad pops up. One can also blinking caret/cursor in input box. Now when we try to scroll the content in wrapper, all the elements within it scroll up/down except blinking caret. Caret doesn't move and even if the input box has moved from it's pre-scroll position. Basically the caret is not in sync with it.  Now if you try to type something, caret jumps back inside the input box. 

The issue is present in actual 3GS/4G device/emulator  and all OS. I wish I can attach a snapshot of the problem here which would have made problem more clear.

Has anyone come across same issue??  Thanks.

Time to integrate Local Storage as if it were another server,"Now that we can claim servers (with OpenID) it is time to make Local Storage in the browser work like a server you've already claimed. This works ok already since we've made editing a claimed site (without login) equivalent to checking the old Local Storage checkbox.

Local Storage is the storage new users will use until they setup servers of their own. Let's help them understand where their edits are going and help them move their edits where they want them when they finally decide where that is. New users will confront two mysteries:
- I've just edited a federated wiki page and the page turned yellow. What could that possibly mean? What happened to my edit? Who can see my change? Can I undo it?
- I've been making edits on several federated wiki sites. Now I want to share these changes on the internet as my own. How can I collect these changes and put them up on some new server? How do I get a server? What steps do I follow to move my Local Storage pages there?

I'm going to suggest two big changes that could be two or more issues in their own right. I will describe them here in order to have a high-level discussion. I'll probably have a go at both of these issues soon enough and it I can't get it done I will write the more specific issues. For now, the two big changes are as follows:
- Model both the origin server and Local Storage as storage devices with a unified API captured as model objects on the client-side. Most of this organization will be invisible to the end user. However, local storage should have its own generated favicon and something useful should happen should the user click it. The favicon for Local Storage should suggest the origin servers favicon modified in some predictable and describable way. I suggest overlaying a cross-hatch pattern over the origin favicon. (See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8337570/best-way-to-mask-an-image-in-html5) 
- Provide a whole-site storage format (in JSON) for moving pages between sites. Add a special page to each server that describes how to move Local Storage pages and offer a 'data' story item that holds all Local Storage pages in that JSON format. (Note: this has to be a client-side mechanism because Local Storage is client side. I'm guessing some ""data url"" trickery can get local storage into the JSON preview window where they (or any other JSON) can be stored to the user's local file system. This means that a user can get a hold of his own pages. Another challenge would be to take a handfull of these sorts of files and upload them in bulk to a brand-new server. 

We can talk about a new-user funnel that will lead to a critical-mass of federated wiki users. That funnel works something like this:
- user finds a federated wiki page
- user groks that federated wiki is something special
- user tries editing, finds that it just works
- user starts curating pages that are personally valuable
- user learns that existing edits can be moved to a public server
- user moves some edits to a public server, likes the result
- user moves remaining local edits to one or more public servers
- user becomes advocate of federated wiki

None of these are big steps. But its time to make sure this path has the minimum of friction.

Admin console load issues on 64-bit,"While this may be the same issue as #17312, the behavior was different enough that I believe it merits a new issue.

Brand new VM with fresh 64-bit JDK and Glassfish 3.1.1 installation (and I confirmed the issue exists in the latest build of 3.1.2, 19). The load for the admin console gui is extremely slow: it takes between 120 and 160 seconds for server.log message containing ""Loading application __admingui done in 154,876"" to write. Visibly, the ""Status: The Admin Console is starting. Please wait."" page keeps spinning, even after that message is logged. The log for this behavior is attached as server.log.networkon.

Originally I thought it the issue was caused by being unable to run the updatetool on x86_64, but after tracking down every library necessary to use the tool the issue remained. I am still unsure of the cause of the issue, though I have found a workaround (credit goes to Damian, [http://stackoverflow.com/a/7436283](http://stackoverflow.com/a/7436283)).

If you disable the VM's network connection the admin console loads as expected (""Loading application __admingui done in 13,526 ms"", and the browser successfully redirects). The log for this behavior is attached as server.log.networkoff. Please note, adding the jvm-option ""-Dcom.sun.enterprise.tools.admingui.NO_NETWORK=true"" did not work; you have to actually disable the VM's network entirely.

Hope this information is useful, especially since the issue exists in yesterday's build. Please let me know if there is any additional information I can provide.

Discover connection strings in projects' web.config and/or app.config (Issue #19),"Hi James,
Hope you're well and have had a nice Christmas and new years!

I've been trying to find some more time to devote to DNM, and this should hopefully be the first drop of many. Again, forgive my rustiness with Github and Git in general - I had to do some horrible things to get the pull request to just the single commit I wanted!

DNM now works pretty damn well with Nuget - its a very simple matter to add the package (I've only tried locally obviously) and then to just start adding migrations against connection strings you've already got set up. Any comments/code review welcome, I'm aware the connection ""add/update/remove"" commands may not function correctly in this configuration but wanted to see what you think first.

I'll still try and find some time to tidy those ""combine"" command commits up and get them to you - I still think this is valuable to have in the core feature set, our DBAs in particular would like to have a nice big script to run themselves come a production upgrade - even though we're using migrations internally! :)

Btw, did you know the TC build is down?

All the best,
Kieran

"int, double, and String have inconsistent capitalization","_This issue was originally filed by gundl...&#064;gmail.com_

---

Please consider renaming &quot;String&quot; to &quot;string.  I know, I'm mostly bikeshedding.  But why isn't &quot;String&quot; &quot;string&quot; if &quot;Int&quot; and &quot;Double&quot; are also lowercased?

I get the impression you lowercased &quot;int&quot; and &quot;double&quot; to make them feel like primitives and to match Java.  Perhaps String is capitalized to match Java, but it's lowercased in C#, so that's a weak argument.

upon restart look only into the tail of log file up to 'bantime' back,"Source distributions from 0.8.4 until 0.8.6 (exclusive) looked straight into the last line in the logfile, thus ignoring all possible errors back (VCS still had ""look at the whole file"" upon restart).  in 0.8.6 behavior changed to look through whole file banning while encountering matching entries.  That is an expensive operation if log files are not rotated frequently.  Ideally upon restart f2b should look only in the tail of the file as far back in time as as 'bantime'. 

Probably it is ok to just read them in the reversed order.

The easiest and least inefficient implementation could use 'reversed()' while reading whole file into RAM, thus might be prohibitively inefficient.   For smarter implementations see

Read NE columns off of CoNLL-style files,"It'd be nice to be able to read the ne columns off of CoNLL-style NER files without using the raw()

I've attached a patch that allows this by allowing more than word/tag/IOB columns to be returned

E.g. c.iob_words(None, (c.WORDS, c.POS, c.CHUNK, c.NE)) would now return [...,('Electric', 'NNP', 'I-
NP', 'I-ORG'),...] but c.iob_words() returns  [...,('Electric', 'NNP', 'I-NP'),...] as before.<p>Migrated from http://code.google.com/p/nltk/issues/detail?id=338</p>

"HTML includes XML declaration and DOCTYPE on 64 bits Ruby, and breaks spec","Hi there!

This is a duplicate of issue https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara/issues/570 , but I am attaching a failing spec and I'll try to explain why I think this is a real issue.

I've attached a failing spec here: https://gist.github.com/1578175

In that issue, @jnicklas closes the issue telling that browsers won't bother about that.

The problem is that because of Nokogiri (or Capybara interacting with it, i am not sure where is the real problem) inserts that xml declaration, Capybara parsing breaks and some of my specs are failing.

Every spec where we test that we have some content, and this content contains accented characters (áéíóú), or where we test that we have a html tag (for example, <iframe></iframe>) that with the xml declaration get converted to <iframe />.

The attached spec works  properly in my laptop (capybara 1.1.1, nokogiri 1.5.0, rack 1.2,5, rack-test 0.5.7, ruby 1.9.2p180), but fails in my CI server (same version of every gem, ruby, etc, only difference is that is a 64 bit machine).

I'll try to find the problem.

#readlines significantly slower than MRI,"Calling #readline in Rubinius is significantly slower than MRI. For example, MRI #readlines requires just a tenth of a second or so, but Rubinius #readlines requires over 5 seconds on a file with 500,000 words separated by line break.
### Steps to reproduce
- Prepare a sample source file to read. For example, run the following with Ruby18 or 19. You can't use Rubinius because of a different issue with map which I'll file another bug for. The following will create a source file with 500,000 words consisting of 8 random characters.

```
SOURCE = 'source.txt'

# File.open(SOURCE, 'w') do |f|
#   500000.times do
#     f.puts (0...8).map{65.+(rand(25)).chr}.join # http://stackoverflow.com/questions/88311/how-best-to-generate-a-random-string-in-ruby
#   end
# end
```
- Run an example of the troubled code:

```
SOURCE = 'source.txt'
file = File.new(SOURCE)
words = file.readlines

p words.size
```

### Conclusion

It appears that IO#read_to_separator and/or IO#gets need some performance tuning in 18, and 19 needs some work in other areas.

A more robust Penn Treebank corpus reader,"I have customized my NLTK installation with a new, more robust corpus reader for the full Penn Treebank (both WSJ and Brown portions). This corpus reader recognizes the categorization of portions of the Treebank into genres (news = WSJ, mystery, romance, etc.):

&gt;&gt;&gt; from nltk.corpus import ptb
&gt;&gt;&gt; ptb.categories()
['adventure', 'belles_lettres', 'fiction', 'humor', 'lore', 'mystery', 'news', 'romance', 'science_fiction']
&gt;&gt;&gt; ptb.parsed_sents(categories='science_fiction')[1]
Tree('S', [Tree('NP-SBJ', [Tree('NP', [Tree('NN', ['Self']), Tree('POS', [&quot;'s&quot;])]), Tree('NN', ['integrity'])]), Tree('VP', [Tree('VP', [Tree('VBD', ['was'])]), Tree('CC', ['and']), Tree('VP', [Tree('VBZ', ['is'])]), Tree('CC', ['and']), Tree('VP', [Tree('ADVP-TMP', [Tree('RB', ['ever'])]), Tree('VBD', ['had']), Tree('VP', [Tree('VBN', ['been'])])])]), Tree('.', ['.'])])

Specifically, I have created the class CategorizedBracketParseCorpusReader—a subclass of both CategorizedCorpusReader and BracketParseCorpusReader—because WSJ and Brown articles contain parses and are also grouped into topical categories.

Since this seems like it would be useful to others working with the Treebank, I am posting the changes here; see the attached patch (relative to 2.0b9).<p>Migrated from http://code.google.com/p/nltk/issues/detail?id=589</p><hr/><h2>earlier comments</h2>

<p>Thanks Nathan.  Does the user of this corpus reader need to work out what to put in the file allcats.txt?  How would we select just the WSJ section of Penn Treebank (since this is not a ""category"")?

Editable requirements don't get symlinked properly.,"I'm running pip 1.0.2 on Ubuntu in a virtual environment.  When using an editable requirement in a requirements file:
-e git+file:///path/to/repo@branch#egg=egg_name
the installation with 'pip install -r requirements' works mostly as expected, checking out the code to 'VENV/src/egg-name'.

The package doesn't show up in the python path though.  There is a text file in site-packages 'egg-name.egg-link' which contains the path 'VENV/src/egg-name'.  If I make a symlink to 'VENV/src/egg-name' in site-packages manually, all is well.

There is a stack overflow question addressing this issue as well:

Tables: Support for multiple <tbody>,"Because a `<table>` is allowed to contain multiple `<tbody>` to build **groups** of rows, it would be nice to style them with Bootstrap.

Example 1: Striped groups:

```
tbody:nth-child(odd) { background: #f5f5f5; }
tbody:nth-child(even) { background: #e5e5e5; }
```

Example 2: Placing a separator between groups:

```
tbody { border-top: 10px solid #ccc; }
tbody:first-of-type { border-top: 0; }
```

But both do **not** work nice with .striped-table. Any ideas?

Problem mapping derived class to multiple destinations,"Please refer to this question on stackoverflow: http://stackoverflow.com/q/8844959/56829

I've defined a map where a base class A is mapped to another base class B.  If I include mappings for a derived type of A, such that it maps to multiple derived types of B, only one of the derived types of B is instantiated.

Consider this mapping:

```
CreateMap<LegacyControl, NewControl>()
    .ConstructUsing(source =>
        {
            // TextBox should map to either TextArea or TextInput
            // based on MultiLine property value

            return ((TextBox)source).MultiLine
                ? (NewControl) new TextArea()
                : (NewControl) new TextInput();
        })
    .Include<TextBox, TextInput>() // not working
    .Include<TextBox, TextArea>(); // working

CreateMap<TextBox, TextInput>();
CreateMap<TextBox, TextArea>();
```

When I map LegacyControls to NewControls, only instances of TextArea are instantiated.

```
[Test]
public void Mapper_should_map_TextBox_to_TextArea()
{
    var textBox = new TextBox {MultiLine = true};
    var textArea = Mapper.Map<LegacyControl, NewControl>(textBox);

    // PASSES    
    Assert.That(textArea, Is.InstanceOf<TextArea>());
}

[Test]
public void Mapper_should_map_TextBox_to_TextInput()
{
    var textBox = new TextBox {MultiLine = false};

Spring team should clearly document all predefined SpEL variables in a centralized place to avoid confusion. In particular, I see no mention of `environment`. See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7885847/list-of-spring-el-variables for details.

## Problem

One common request I see quite frequently on the internet is the ability to have spring autowire a main class:

- http://hvijay.wordpress.com/2011/07/02/spring-dependency-injection-in-applications-main-class/
- http://forum.springsource.org/archive/index.php/t-47933.html
- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6820724/how-to-inject-properties-into-a-spring-bean-from-main-class
- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8313070/spring-bean-injection-in-main-method-class
- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3659720/spring-3-autowire-in-standalone-application
- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4787719/spring-console-application-configured-using-annotations
- http://forum.springsource.org/showthread.php?75991-ContextConfiguration

There is no shortage of questions / solutions to this problem which illustrates a need for a standardized approach.

## Solution

What I am proposing is combination of features between the following existing classes:

1. `org.springframework.test.context.junit4.SpringJUnit4ClassRunner` - provides functionality of the Spring TestContext Framework to standard JUnit 4.5+ tests
2. `org.springframework.test.context.ContextConfiguration` - class-level metadata that is used to determine how to load and configure an ApplicationContext for test classes
3. `org.springframework.web.context.support.SpringBeanAutowiringSupport` a convenient base class for self-autowiring classes that gets constructed within a Spring-based web application.

Thus provinding first class support for console based application context management and DI.

## Features

1. Autowiring of main class dependencies
2. Auto-destruction of application context
3. Ability in the future to handle command line arguments as beans

## Properties

1. Standardization
2. Consistency with other APIs
3. Minimal configuration
4. Intent revealing

## Example

My visions is something like the following:

```
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.context.MainSupport;
import org.springframework.context.ContextConfiguration;
import org.springframework.context.support.AnnotationConfigContextLoader;

@ContextConfiguration(classes=AppConfig.class, loader=AnnotationConfigContextLoader.class)
public class Main extends MainSupport {
    
    @Autowired
    private Service service;

    public static void main( String[] args ) {
        // MainSupport.execute
        execute(args);
    }
    
    @Main
    public void main() {
        service.run();
    }
    
}
```

The way this would work is as follows:

1. JVM calls `main`
2. `main` delegates to super class method `MainSupport.execute` provided by spring (analog of `SpringBeanAutowiringSupport`)
3. `MainSupport.execute` reads the `@ContextConfiguration` annotation and looks for a `@Main` annotation (analog of `@Test`)
4. `MainSupport.execute` creates the application context
5. `MainSupport.execute` create an application `Main` class instance
6. `MainSupport.execute` injects dependencies
7. `MainSupport.execute` wraps instance in a proxy that will advise the method annotated with `@Main`. This proxy will first call the annotated method and then destroy the application context

The Javadoc for `@RequestMapping`#value talks about method names taken into account for narrowing if no path is specified explicitly in case of ambiguous annotation mappings. And also discusses a default method (without explicit path mapping).

Those are not supported in the new RequestMappingHandlerMapping/RequestMappingHandlerAdapter pair and the above Javadoc needs an update.

Currently an exceptions in Async proxied methods fail silently and do not pass to the default UncaughtExceptionHandler. This means you need to wrap every async method with AspectJ in order to achieve unexpected error handling in these methods.

e.g.

`@Override`
`@Async`
public void asyncExceptionTest() {
int i=1/0;
}

This will fail silently.

"Read/write binary representation of int32, int64 and float","**Original bug ID:** 5494
**Reporter:** @mjambon
**Status:** resolved (set by @xavierleroy on 2012-03-14T09:37:25Z)
**Resolution:** suspended
**Priority:** normal
**Severity:** feature
**Platform:** All
**Version:** 3.12.1
**Category:** standard library

## Bug description

It would be convenient to have fast and reliable functions for reading
and writing the binary representation of int32, int64 and float
(without going through int64). Here is an interface suggestion:

All functions read or write a string at the specified position.

Modules Int32 and Int64:

val read_binary : string -> int -> t
val write_binary : string -> int -> t -> unit
val unsafe_read_binary : string -> int -> t
val unsafe_write_binary : string -> int -> t -> unit

Module Pervasives if not Float:

val read_binary_float : string -> int -> float
val write_binary_float : string -> int -> float -> unit
val unsafe_read_binary_float : string -> int -> float
val unsafe_write_binary_float : string -> int -> float -> unit


For the record, I am currently using the following code for floats
in https://github.com/mjambon/biniou/blob/master/bi_io.ml .
It is somewhat fragile to say the least:

let float_endianness =
  match String.unsafe_get (Obj.magic 1.0) 0 with
      '\x3f' -> `Big
    | '\x00' -> `Little
    | _ -> assert false

let read_untagged_float64 ib =
  let i = Bi_inbuf.read ib 8 in
  let s = ib.i_s in
  let x = Obj.new_block Obj.double_tag 8 in
  (match float_endianness with
       `Little ->
	 for j = 0 to 7 do
	   String.unsafe_set (Obj.obj x) (7-j) (String.unsafe_get s (i+j))
	 done
     | `Big ->
	 for j = 0 to 7 do
	   String.unsafe_set (Obj.obj x) j (String.unsafe_get s (i+j))
	 done
  );
  (Obj.obj x : float)

let write_untagged_float64 ob x =
  let i = Bi_outbuf.alloc ob 8 in
  let s = ob.o_s in
  (match float_endianness with
       `Little ->
	 for j = 0 to 7 do
	   String.unsafe_set s (i+j) (String.unsafe_get (Obj.magic x) (7-j))
	 done
     | `Big ->
	 for j = 0 to 7 do
	   String.unsafe_set s (i+j) (String.unsafe_get (Obj.magic x) j)
	 done
  )

let () =
  let s = ""\x3f\xf0\x06\x05\x04\x03\x02\x01"" in
  let x = 1.00146962706651288 in
  let y = read_untagged_float64 (Bi_inbuf.from_string s) in
  if x <> y then
    assert false;
  let ob = Bi_outbuf.create 8 in
  write_untagged_float64 ob x;
  if Bi_outbuf.contents ob <> s then
    assert false

Add symlinks to Python shared library in $VIRTUAL_ENV/lib,"Hi,

I compiled a CPython 2.7.2 with the --enable-shared option. As a consequence, some libpython.so.\* are generated in $PYTHONHOME/lib

Would it be possible to add symlinks to these libraries in $VIRTUAL_ENV/lib when creating the virtualenv ? It would be less confusing to export LD_LIBRARY_PATH on this folder than on the $PYTHONHOME/lib one when installing some packages including C (such as netifaces) ?

import nltk package and subpackages - should be faster / less import->import->import,"I found nltk great package, professional, stable and with lot of features. 

But, when i do: 
&gt;&gt;&gt; import nltk

it takes some time. It is nothing critical but when you test applications
again and again, this &quot;slow&quot; import time becomes more and more obvious.
Also, my preassumption is that normal user of nltk will use maybe only 10%
of the whole package in most cases.

Suggestion is to remove from nltk/**init**.py: 
     import chunk;     from chunk import *
     import classify;  from classify import *
     ...
     import misc
     import toolbox

Then import nltk won't be so greedy.

Then documentation for such packages should be changed:

Imported by default - usage:
&gt;&gt;&gt; import nltk
&gt;&gt;&gt; nltk.tokenize

Not imported by default - usage:
When you drop out from nltk/**init**.py line &quot;import tokenize&quot; then use of
&quot;nltk.tokenize&quot; is not valid any more. Then you must use:
&gt;&gt;&gt; import nltk, nltk.tokenize 
&gt;&gt;&gt; nltk.tokenize

The only problem I see is, **that existing code will stop to function - but
fix is very easy**. 

I also prefer doing this (which I don't expect that should load the whole
nltk package tree): 
&gt;&gt;&gt; from nltk.tokenize import PunktWordTokenizer
&gt;&gt;&gt; p = PunktWordTokenizer()

This is more explicit

<p>Loading is too slow, for the reasons you cite.  However, the book examples were
greatly simplified when we got ""import nltk"" to include everything.  Its too late to
change that.  Here's some other possibilities:

We could be more selective, and cut down the things that are imported by default, so
long as it doesn't break examples in the book.  However, this might cause confusion
as users won't be able to guess what's imported by default or not.

We could import lazily [http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/Importing], though I
don't think this will help for imports like ""from nltk.foo import *"".

Note that lazy imports would also solve issue 377 and issue 385.

</p><p><strong>trebor74hr said, at 2009-05-27T19:27:45.000Z:</strong></p>
<p>General rule I would suggest is to depend on smallest set of external packages as
possible. Using new package for this
[http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/Importing] I wouldn't suggest.

I think that ""We could be more selective, and cut down the things that are imported
by default, so long as it doesn't break examples in the book."" is good way to do it. 

Some implementation ""tips"" that could be useful: 

 1. is to use __all__ in package: 
  from nltk import *
  would import everything from __all__ in nltk/__init__.py (see
[http://docs.python.org/tutorial/modules.html#importing-from-a-package]). 

 2. in order to check source is runnable - you could check examples in book by
running doctest against
[http://docs.python.org/library/doctest.html?highlight=doctest#module-doctest]. If
you could setup book source to be online documentation, base for pdf version of book,
and runnable by doctest for testing, that would be very good. Probably you know about
sphinx [http://sphinx.pocoo.org/] - which could be good way to achive this. Btw. big
python projects like python itself [http://docs.python.org/] and django
[http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/] switched to it. 
</p><p><strong>StevenBird1 said, at 2009-05-27T21:00:57.000Z:</strong></p>
<p>We could easily clone that package for lazy-importing a module; this wouldn't add a
new external dependency.  We already use __all__ in our sub-packages, so adding
__all__ to the top-level __init__ file duplicates the manual naming of sub-package
contents while introducing the risk of inconsistencies.  We already check book
examples using doctest, not that this would help with the load problem.
</p><p><strong>trebor74hr said, at 2009-05-28T13:12:01.000Z:</strong></p>
<p>Great to hear that. It seems that lazy imports are not so rare as I thought so:
 - there is PEP ralated to this - http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0369/ and I
found some discussion at
http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2008-January/076011.html 
 - from peak.util.imports import lazyModule - which you suggested
 - http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zope.deferredimport
 - mercurial has it - mercurial.demandimport (source packages
http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/release/?M=D)
 - mx.DateTime has it - source preview I found here
http://www.koders.com/python/fidB2399BD41CC244D09D89AD0178CC1D2EAFE9F491.aspx?s=cdef%3Aparser,
download package from here http://www.egenix.com/products/python/mxBase/
 - receipe http://code.activestate.com/recipes/473888/

After all, maybe this is not a bad idea ;)
</p><p><strong>trebor74hr said, at 2009-05-28T13:52:54.000Z:</strong></p>
<p>I haven't checked implementations, I assume that you don't access directly module,
but some proxy object. If this is a case then there are some drawbacks (than I can
now think of): 
 - dir(module_ref) or module_ref.__dict__ - shows content of proxy object
 - sys.modules - doesn't see module until loaded (what is normal)
 - del module_ref - should be implemented in proxy to delete ref to loaded module too

Probably there are more issues to consider when choosing the lazy import
implementation, when integrating, and when checking the existing functionality.
</p><p><strong>StevenBird1 said, at 2009-05-31T11:55:21.000Z:</strong></p>
<p>I've tried a conservative solution, and done some profiling on the ""import nltk"", and

<p>I just checked out the code, rebuilt and tested 'import nltk'. It's certainly faster than it used to be (I also noticed 
the sluggishness of that import before).</p><p><strong>trebor74hr said, at 2009-06-01T09:25:39.000Z:</strong></p>
<p>I tested svn-trunk r8134, on my (not fast) computer and my impression is that it is
not much faster. But I didn't measured before, so I can't tell you how much faster it
is. So I did profiling now. If you don't something similar - do some profiling before
and after change and compare. 

I did it like this (win32):

R:\env-lib\Python25\Lib\site-packages>python -c""import
hotshot;p=hotshot.Profile('r.prof');p.run('import nltk');p.close();import
hotshot.stats;s=hotshot.stats.load('r.prof');s.sort_stats('time');s.print_stats()"" >

So 4 calls to re.compile() is taking your system 207 seconds?  That seems pretty
extreme to me.  When I run the same code I get roughly comparable numbers of function
calls & primitive calls, but the whole import executes in 0.507 CPU seconds (incl
profiling time).  That's 10,000x faster than it's executing for you!  I wonder what
could cause such extreme differences.

Here's the top bit of profiling information when I run profiling on the import
(horizontally compressed a little to display better):

<p>To get rid of some of the noise, it can be good to profile over more than just one
call to ""import nltk"".  We can do this with:

for i in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10; do echo $i; python -c""import
hotshot;p=hotshot.Profile('r$i.prof');p.run('import nltk');p.close()""; done; cat
r*.prof >all.prof; python -c ""import
hotshot.stats;s=hotshot.stats.load('all.prof');s.sort_stats('cum'); s.print_stats()"" 

(This repeats the import 10 times; more might be better, assuming you're on a
decently fast computer.)

<p>I'm sorry if I left wrong impression, I didn't wanted to be the person who will test
speed of nltk. I just wanted to point out that profiling tools (e.g. hotshot) can be
useful in finding bottlenecks. 

The tests which I runned before were runned on Amd Atlon63 x2 dual 3800+, win xp pro,
but the system is slowed down by antivirus, firewall, etc., so I wouldn't suggest
using these timing data as reference one. 

To answer to this:
   ""That's 10,000x faster than it's executing for you! I wonder what could cause such
extreme differences.""
tottime 300 - took 2-2.5 seconds, how you get seconds from these units, I don't
really know (btw. I'm beginner in profiling stuff).

Anyway, I wrote short script for doing loading / unloading for 5 times - with some
hacking for unloading the module (for which I don't guarantee ;) ): 

---------------------

import datetime, sys
import hotshot, hotshot.stats
import pdb

def unload_nltk():
    # sys.modules says:
    #       ""Note that removing a module from this dictionary is not the same as
calling reload()""
    # I read this: it is not forbidden to do this ;)
    # see also:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/437589/how-do-i-unload-reload-a-python-module
    for modname in sys.modules.keys():
        if modname.startswith(""nltk""):
            del sys.modules[modname]
    for modname in sys.modules.keys():
        if modname.startswith(""nltk""):
            raise Exception(""%s still loaded"" % modname)
    

p=hotshot.Profile('r.prof')
for i in range(5):
    unload_nltk()
    print ""%4s end   %s"" % (i, datetime.datetime.now().isoformat("" ""))
    p.run('import nltk')
    print ""%4s start %s"" % (i, datetime.datetime.now().isoformat("" ""))
p.close()

s=hotshot.stats.load('r.prof')
s.sort_stats('time')
s.print_stats()

The result is in attachment, It took 9 seconds or 10045 units, and here are first N

I see -- Windows must be using strange units or something.  The first line of your
r.txt file said ""5575.533 CPU seconds"", which suggests an almost 2-hour import time,
but if it completed in 2-3 seconds then something must be off there.  In
linux/unix/os x, the times listed by pstats are all in (CPU) seconds.

I'll continue to do a little more profiling to see if this can be sped up more.  One
candidate is precompiling regexps: we precompile ~450 regexps whenever nltk is
imported.  That ends up taking up about 25% of the total import time.  The modules
that spend the most time compiling regexps (and the amount of time spent, as a
percentage of total time spent compiling regexps), are:

   26% python2.5/site-packages/yaml/reader.py
    9% nltk/chat/util.py
    9% python2.5/tokenize.py
    8% python2.5/xml/etree/ElementTree.py
    6% nltk/etree/ElementTree.py
    6% python2.5/site-packages/yaml/resolver.py
    3% nltk/featstruct.py
    2% python2.5/HTMLParser.py
    2% nltk/corpus/reader/xmldocs.py
    1% nltk/grammar.py
   23% <all other modules>

<p>I think the book should really be changed, so that only the minimum is loaded normally.

However, perhaps something like ""from nltk.all import *"" could be helpful, to load
everything like it does now? ""import nltk"" could then be optimised for applications
using nltk.</p><p><strong>trebor74hr said, at 2010-06-28T08:15:00.000Z:</strong></p>

<p>I'm very reluctant to break lots of examples published in the book in order to solve this problem with slow imports.

I've studied the book examples, and find cases where names from the following packages are presumed to be available at the top level (i.e. nltk.package.name is available as nltk.name): chunk, classify, metrics, parse, tag, tokenize, sem.  The remaining three packages that are imported into the top level namespace (inference, model, stem) might be able to be imported on demand.

It would be good if yaml was only imported on demand, to save on the time required to compile all of its regular expressions (reported in comment 13).

I suggest we resolve this issue in NLTK 3.0 by having minimal extra importing there.

</p><p><strong>StevenBird1 said, at 2011-03-11T04:40:12.000Z:</strong></p>
<p>We can't import yaml on demand, since some of the tagger classes inherit from it (which means they must import yaml) and some taggers are used in the book with just the nltk.name style of import (which means that the top-level init file must import all names from the tag package).

"scale, reduce colors and sharpen in one step","Unfortunately there is no user mailinglist. According to the wiki, questions can be asked here....

Here is my question

I need to reduce the byte size of a color scan.

Up to now I think the following steps should be made:
- sharpen to reduce noise
- scale to ~120dpi
- reduce colors

Doing these steps one after the other wouldn't be the best result. To get the best result, I need a tool which can make these steps in one optimized algorithm.

Up to now we use convert (imagemagick) and net-ppm tools. But I want to switch to a library. I think VIPS would be a good choice.

The scans are invoices, not photos.

Any hints appreciated.

Provide support for ApplicationContextInitializers in the TestContext framework [SPR-9011],"**[Rossen Stoyanchev](https://jira.spring.io/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=rstoya05-aop)** opened **[SPR-9011](https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-9011?redirect=false)** and commented

#### Status Quo

Starting with Spring 3.1 applications can specify `contextInitializerClasses` via `context-param` and `init-param` in `web.xml`.

---

#### Goals

For comprehensive testing it should be possible to re-use `ApplicationContextInitializer` instances in tests as well.

This could be done at the `@ContextConfiguration` level by allowing an array of ACI types to be specified, and the TCF would allow each to visit the `ApplicationContext` at the right time.

---

#### Deliverables

1. 

[x] Introduce a new `initializers` attribute in `@ContextConfiguration`.

---

```
     ```

```

Class<? extends ApplicationContextInitializer<? extends ConfigurableApplicationContext>>[] initializers() default {};

```
1. [x] Introduce a new `inheritInitializers` attribute in `@ContextConfiguration`.
   - ```
boolean inheritInitializers() default true;
```

1. [x] Allow a context to be loaded solely via a custom `ApplicationContextInitializer` (i.e., without locations or classes)

2. [x] Initializers must be included in `MergedContextConfiguration` for determining the context cache key.

3. [x] Invoke initializers within existing `SmartContextLoader` implementations.

   - for example, in `AbstractGenericContextLoader.loadContext(...)` methods

   - 

   [x] per the contract defined in the Javadoc for `ApplicationContextInitializer`: _`ApplicationContextInitializer` processors are encouraged to detect whether Spring's `Ordered` interface has been implemented or if the `@Order` annotation is present and to sort instances accordingly if so prior to invocation._
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   ```
          ```

   ```

Collections.sort(initializerInstances, new AnnotationAwareOrderComparator());

```
1. [x] Document in Javadoc
1. [x] Document in the reference manual

----
#### Pseudocode Examples

```java 
@RunWith(SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class)
@ContextConfiguration(
    locations = ""/app-config.xml"",
    initializers = CustomInitializer.class)
public class ApplicationContextInitializerTests {}
```

```java
@RunWith(SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class)
@ContextConfiguration(
    locations = ""/app-config.xml"",
    initializers = {PropertySourceInitializer.class, ProfileInitializer.class})
public class ApplicationContextInitializerTests {}
```

```java
@RunWith(SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class)
@ContextConfiguration(
    classes = BaseConfig.class,
    initializers = BaseInitializer.class)
public class BaseTest {}

@ContextConfiguration(
    classes = ExtendedConfig.class,
    initializers = ExtendedInitializer.class)
public class ExtendedTest extends BaseTest {}
```

```java
@RunWith(SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class)
@ContextConfiguration(
    classes = BaseConfig.class,
    initializers = BaseInitializer.class)
public class BaseTest {}

@ContextConfiguration(
    classes = ExtendedConfig.class,
    initializers = ExtendedInitializer.class,
    inheritInitializers = false)
public class ExtendedTest extends BaseTest {}
```

```java
// In the following example, an exception would not be thrown even
// if no default XML file or @Configuration class is detected.
// In other words, the initializer would be responsible for 
// providing XML configuration files or annotated configuration
// classes to the provided context.
@ContextConfiguration(initializers = EntireAppInitializer.class)
public class InitializerWithoutConfigFilesOrClassesTest extends BaseTest  {}
```

Improve DefaultKeyGenerator [SPR-9036],"**[Bozhidar Bozhanov](https://jira.spring.io/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=bozho)** opened **[SPR-9036](https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-9036?redirect=false)** and commented

org.springframework.cache.interceptor.DefaultKeyGenerator is implemented by calculating the hashcode of all arguments. This is problematic in many cases:

- methods with similar signature - foo(int, String), foo(int, List)  - if the 2nd argument is null they will get mixed
- methods with the same signature in different classes, using the same cache - they will get mixed
- is there a collision resolution mechanism? If not, things will randomly fail. Rarely, but they will. Imagine that the arguments of two distinct methods (that use the same cache region) evaluate to the same hashcode (not unlikely) - they will override each other's values, and possibly a ClassCastException will occur on retrieval

What is in the first place the reason to get the hashcodes? The underlying cache mechanism is a hashtable of some sort, so it will calculate the hash of the key anyway. But it will have a collision-resolution strategy, unlike the KeyGenerator.

I suggest:

- concatenating the string representations of primitives, and the hashcode of non-primitives.
- adding the class name and method name to the key
- optionally, where non-primitive values are used as keys, log a warning - this is usually wrong, as the hashcode will change even though the values inside the object are the same

document() should have an option not to generate the NAMESPACE,"Sometimes I want to update my documentation .Rd files, but not rewrite my NAMESPACE, but I don't see this as an option for the document function.  In particular, it seems that the order that commands appear in NAMESPACE matters, but document doesn't generate a consistent order.  There may be other reasons as well that a developer wants to update the .Rd without messing with the NAMESPACE.  Thanks for considering this and sorry if I've misunderstood how this works.

Image load from remote url,"I might be missing something _really_ obvious here, but I can't see that loading images from a url works (data urls work fine).

Example:

```

'http://remysharp.com/images/remy.jpg'

Never shows ""image loaded"".  I've been porting client side canvas code to server side with very little changes, but loading remote images seem to be tripping me up.  I'm happy to mod my code to run a http.request on the url and then pass in the buffer to the `Image` but it seemed like loading images from a url should be there - so figuring I might be doing something wrong?

ti milestones not implemented?,"Hello,
I have the feeling the command ""milestone"" is not implemented.

If I look at the code (also comparing with other commands), I can see a function

```
def parser(opts)

But (differently from other command) I did not found a function

```
def execute

which is pointing to the actual milestone implementation.
The command seems is not doing anything when I launch it.

Am I missing something?

Function1/PartialFunction ScalaDocs violate LSP,"There is much confusion about PartialFunction vs Function1, and I believe this is caused by lack of documentation. Specifically, the following mail from Martin Odersky is not reflected in Function1/PartialFunction ScalaDocs, as of 2.9.1:
http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.scala.internals/2057

Specifically, Function1 ScalaDocs should explain that the domain is not specified, while PartialFunction ScalaDocs should explain that the domain is now specified, and should clarify (once and for all) whether PartialFunction.apply is allowed to throw exceptions on the domain. In particular, I believe that it should be allowed, otherwise the following code should become illegal:
val f: PartialFunction[Int, Any] = { case _ => 1/0 }
(it compiles on Scala 2.9.1 REPL).
Aaron Novstrup* suggested that whenever PartialFunction.apply throws an exception, that exception must be ""part of the design of the function (and should be documented)"", which makes sense.

jScrollPane doesn't stick to bottom,"I use jScrollPane for the scrollbars in a simple chat interface I designed. The issue I have here is that jScrollPane doesn't scroll to the bottom automatically. jScrollPane does have a handy option 'stickToBottom' that I've set to true and also I've set 'autoReinitalise' to true since content gets added to the specific div dynamically. Now, as soon as the chatbox is getting filled and scrollbars are added I expected jScrollPane to automatically scroll to the bottom and stick there. But this isn't the case. I first manually have to scroll to the bottom and then it will stick there. So I tried to create an innerdiv with the height 1 pixel more than it's parent (that has the scrollbars) so that from the beginning scrollbars are visible. Via the api I then scroll to 100% over the Y-axis so that the scrollhandle is totally down. But also in this case when my chatbox is being filled and content is exceeding the available space the scrollbar doesn't stick to the bottom, it even scrolls almost to the top again.

I've set up a very simple testpage that has this issue:

Feature request: a way to detect if Angular finished rendering of HTML DOM,"We often need to do some operations on DOM nodes, e.g. bind custom events to them (like ""mouseover"", ""click"" or ""dblclick""), but Angular changes DOM eventually at the end of digest cycle.

What we need is a way to bind some handler upon DOM modification by Angular is finished and it's safe to handle DOM elements (so they won't disappear next moment). From what I understand ng:init runs only once per node on first document rendering and doesn't guarantee any surrounding nodes are rendered.

Is there a way to set a hook to run on end of digest cycle after all DOM nodes are rendered, so it's safe to go on with DOM operations?

Discovering all timers within the container,"It would be nice to have a well defined way to access all timers available in the container. Right now, we can fetch only timers associated with particular bean using i.e. injected TimerService and its getTimers().

How about defining either:

a.) additional method, i.e.

TimerService#getAllTimers()

b.) overloaded method, i.e.:

TimerService#getTimers(boolean containerWide)

when set to 'true' it would return all available timers on the container level; when set to 'false' it would return bean-private timers only.
TimerService#getTimers() and TimerService#getTimers(false) must yield the same results.

ActiveRecord: Can't apply conditions on objects eager loaded via includes,"As far as I can tell, it's currently not possible to apply conditions to models that are eager loaded using the `includes` method. For instance, given the following models...

``` ruby
class Shift < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :schedules
end

class Schedule < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :shift
end
```

...and a desire to select all shifts, eager loading any schedules that occur on a given date, one would think to do something like:

``` ruby
Shift.includes(:schedules).where(:schedules => { :occurs_on => Date.today })
```

Unfortunately, this will cause any shifts without schedules for the given day to be removed from the results as the filtering occurs in the `where` clause.

Shouldn't there be a way to apply conditions on the associated objects to be eager loaded? The best I've been able to come up with is:

``` ruby
Shift.includes(:schedules).where(""schedules.occurs_on is null OR schedules.occurs_on = '#{Date.today}'"")
```

This is ugly and non obvious. Additionally, it only works in cases where schedules records would never have a null occurs_on value. That works in this example, but not in all cases. Ideally, I'd be able to say:

``` ruby
Shift.includes(:schedules => {:occurs_on => Date.today}}
```

But when doing this, ActiveRecord errors saying that :occurs_on is not a relation. This syntax is already used for nesting includes.

Has this issue been discussed before? Is there an existing solution I'm not aware of or does anyone have any suggestions on how a patch would work to address this?

One thing that seems to help is running tornado from python 2.7 instead of python 2.6 - errors occur 5 times less frequently, in my last quick test (but sadly are not done away with completely)

Is there anything that can be done in the tornado code to try and avoid these?  Or perhaps some way that we could use tornado differently to avoid them?

Support for querying against @MappedSuperclass ,"Hi Timo!

I've posted this on StackOverflow:

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8702542/can-i-remove-the-discriminator-column-in-a-hibernate-single-table-inheritance

and you said to create a ticket here as this ""is easily implemented"" ;)

Basicly we'll need the @MappedSuperclass annotation to be treated as an @Entity annotation when generating querytypes.

Summary of our setup:

We are working with single table inheritance for all entities in our application but don't need or want a discriminator column in the database as it would be redundant and cost a lot of space and performance. Hibernate's alternative instead of using 

@Entity
@Inheritance(strategy = InheritanceType.SINGLE_TABLE)

(which is already supported by queryDSL) is to use 

@MappedSuperclass

so that no discriminator type is required to map the data from an extended entity back to its abstract parent object.

However: The Query DSL querytype generator does not generate an accessor for @MappedSuperclass.

Example:

@MappedSuperclass
@Inheritance(strategy = InheritanceType.SINGLE_TABLE)@Table(name = ""client"")
public abstract class Client extends AbstractPersistable<Long> {
    private String name;
    // getter, setter...
}

+

@Entity
public class ClientSimple extends Client {

should support a query like this:

query.where(QClient.client.name.equals(""...""));

with the query.list ultimately returning a List of Client objects than can then be mapped to ClientSimple objects.

This behaviour is neccessairy, because another application instance of the same base application might extend the Client in a different way (ClientAdvanced) but still has to use most of the same querying methods to find objects of the Client type but then cast them to ClientAdvanced.

UITextView repainting issue when reopening a view,"I've integrated ViewDeck - very cool experience - and for the most part I have been able to work around integrating other projects that assume as standard IOS UIKit implementation.

One issue that baffles me, however, is a repainting issue with UITextView.  It only happens when I use ViewDeck to own the UIViewController containing the UITextView.

On launch of the app, I display a UIViewController that contains a UITextView with content in it.   All content is shown properly.   This UIViewController is the ""center"" or ""main panel"".

Just like Facebook's app does, I have a trigram in the upper left nav bar, and the user can slide the center panel away to see a menu in a UITableView.  All good here too.

However, when the user _reselects_ the menu item to display the original center panel, the UITextView:
- contains all of the content
- however it does not display it all, it only displays the text on the left 1/3 of the panel.
- the remaining text is not painted visually on the screen, but it exists inside the UITextView.

This issue only happens when I'm in the ViewDeck model.   I'm a fairly experienced developer and have tested all sorts of things, including repainting the UITextView in a delayed performSelector after all the animation for the ViewDeck is completed.  No luck.

EntryAlignment bug on iPad,"I noticed a bug with entry elements on the iPad. When using them without specifying a fixed `EntryAlignment` for the section, then the indent that is used for the text fields increases whenever the view is loaded. So the first time the view is loaded, everything looks fine, but if you go back and forth then the indentation keeps increasing. In the worst case, the text fields disappear from the view, because the identation is too big.

I have a test code below; simply create an empty iPad project and replace the `Main.cs` with the code below (make sure to reference MT.D of course).

See also [this animation](http://i.imgur.com/ETjPI.gif) that visualizes exactly what happens when switching the views back and forth.

``` C#

using MonoTouch.UIKit;

    {

Listening to all incoming connections by default may be a security concern, but I'm not entirely sure.

Cannot access path helpers created by omniauth?,"I have an app that uses Devise for authentication, and also makes use of the omniauth-facebook plugin (so that users can sign in via Facebook.)

It looks like path helper's of the form:

``` ruby

```

fails in correctly pointing to the main application's `user_omniauth_authorize_path(:facebook)` url.

The reason is because this particular path is created by Devise, and isn't included in the routes.

What is the cleanest way of accessing this path from within Forem?

More generally, how do you access paths defined in the main_app but which aren't in the routes?

Issues Integrating to Project,"I am currently running xCode 4.2 for an iOS 5 project. I have been trying a variety of methods for getting this project to work in my code. The one that seems most promising is:
1) Drag the xcodeproject file into my project
2) In my build Phases I add the target dependencies:
  ybase64additionsTests, ybase64-iOS, ybase64additions-iOS, ycocoaadditions-iOS, yoauth-iOS, yoauthadditions-iOS, ybase64Tests, ycocoaadditionsTests, yoauthTests, ytoolkit, yoauthadditionsTests, ytoolkitbundle, and ycocoaadditions-MACOSX 
3) I then go to Link Binary with Libraries and add:
  libybase64.a, libybase64additions.a, libycocoaadditions.a, libyoauth.a, libyoauthadditions.a, and libycocoaadditions.a (which shows up twice for some reason, but I get same errors if I remove this duplicate).
4) Add {BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR}/usr/local/include/ to the Header Search Paths in Build Settings

I then compile and get two Mach-O link (symbol) errors one for _ybase64_encode, and one for _ybase64_decode. Symbol not found for architecture i386. I have tried several ways to fix this but can't seem to find one that works. I have also tried running the demo but as soon as I build I get a build error for ""ASIHTTPRequest.h"" file not found from FacebookLoginViewController.h.

I am fairly new to iOS development so I am assuming I am doing something dumb with my build order but I'm not sure what. Any help would be very much appreciated!

Thanks!

Integration of css-selectors in jOOX,"Hello Christer,

I'm thrilled to see that you already implemented most (if not all) of the CSS selector parsing in Java. This looks like quite good work!

I'm the developer of jOOX, a jquery port to Java, and I would like to integrate the CSS selector syntax into jOOX. Currently, jOOX only allows for using XPath, which is slightly less intuitive. See some information about jOOX here:

http://code.google.com/p/joox/
https://github.com/lukaseder/jOOX

I am now putting a bit more effort into jOOX, as I see great potential in it (giving most credit to its inspiration jquery, of course).

Now, in order to integrate your project css-selectors into jOOX, there are a couple of open questions:
- css-selectors is not in Maven Central, nor is www.fishtank.se available. Is this still an active project?
- Are you interested in a collaboration, or would you prefer if I forked your project?
- Your licenses (BSD, MIT) are a bit more permissive than mine (ASL 2.0), which means I am allowed to integrate your project in mine, without changing my own license. Do you agree with this? Otherwise, since you don't seem to worry so much about your license, would you mind adding ASL 2.0 to the list of choosable licenses? Some insight can be found here:

Either locally or live the results look like this: http://www.leadminepond.com/tutorials/less/ 

When I enter ""http://www.leadminepond.com/tutorials/less/style.less"" in either IE9 or Chrome I get a 404 error saying the file does not exist, but it _is_ in the folder. Any thoughts?

Thanks!

scrollable inside toggle element never shows,"I'm using scrollable inside a jquery-mobile collapsible. 

Collapsibles have a header and content section. The content section containing scrollable is hidden by default and will be shown once the header is clicked. 

Everything works fine, except that the content section never shows, because scrollable/jquery tools is setting the parent element to _display: none_. 

Any idea how to override this and make the scrollable parent element visible?

Symfony 2 lowercase-uppercase the “i” letter locale bug,"PHP Version 5.3.5

Symfony Version 2.0.9 Standard

ArchLinux 3.1.6-1

Reproduce:

Change your locale to Turkish: ""tr_TR.utf8""

Downloaded latest Symfony 2.0.9 Standard Edition and execute the script:

http://localhost/Symfony/web/app_dev.php/

Produces error: 
ErrorException: Warning: constant() [function.constant]: Couldn't find constant Monolog\Logger::iNFO in /opt/lampp/htdocs/Symfony/vendor/symfony/src/Symfony/Bundle/MonologBundle/DependencyInjection/MonologExtension.php line 102

In Turkish language look at these letters:

Lowercase ""i"" turns to ""?"" in uppercase.

Lowercase ""?"" turns to ""I"" in uppercase.

I think this convention is where it conflicts with English language and causes this kind of errors.

Possible bug in Uglifier call from Sprockets,"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8692666/rails-3-1-possible-bug-in-asset-pipeline-and-uglifier

I ran into a problem deploying on Heroku do to a failure in the rake task

rake assets:precompile
At the bottom is the error I get if I integrate

Rails 3.1
Jquery calendar: https://github.com/themouette/jquery-week-calendar

The error happens from uglifier.

I suspect that problem could be related to the inclusion of many localizations for the calendar.

I worked around the error by setting:
# Compress JavaScripts and CSS

config.assets.compress = false
I was not able to examine the files as the temporary files are cleaned up. I also could not get the debugger in RubyMine to stop at a breakpoint.

Any ideas if this is a bug? Any way to get the temporary files to not get deleted? Any way to make the RubyMine debugger work on the rake task (yes, tried the obvious, using EAP 112-291.

Callback/errback in event streaming,"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8718860/handling-event-stream-connections-in-a-sinatra-app

There is [a great example of a chat app using Server-Sent Events](https://gist.github.com/1476463) by Konstantin Haase @rkh. I am trying to run it and have a problem with callbacks (I use Sinatra 1.3.2 and Chrome 16). They seem not to run (e.g. after page reload), and therefore the number of connections is growing.

Also, the connection is closed in 30-60 sec unless one sets a periodic timer to send empty data, as suggested by Konstantin elsewhere. 

Can you replicate it? If yes, is it possible to fix these issues somehow? WebSockets work seamlessly in this respect...

``` ruby
    get '/stream', provides: 'text/event-stream' do
      stream :keep_open do |out|
        EventMachine::PeriodicTimer.new(20) { out << ""data: \n\n"" } # added
        settings.connections << out
        puts settings.connections.count # added
        out.callback { puts 'closed'; settings.connections.delete(out) } # modified
      end
    end
```

``` javascript
      var es = new EventSource('/stream');
      es.onmessage = function(e) { if (e.data != '') $('#chat').append(e.data + ""\n"") }; // modified
```

How would I render a nested array,"Consider the following JSON:

``` json
{ ""locations"" : [ ""All"",
      ""Europe"",
      ""Asia"",
      ""America"",
      ""India""

```

I'm using this JS:

``` javascript
Tempo.prepare(""locations"").render(data.locations);
```

I need to render this JSON on a page. What should I use as a placeholder for the name of the location?

e.g.

``` html
<ul id=""locations"" class=""menu"">
    <li data-template>
        {{?????}}
    </li>
</ul>
```

Example Site doesnt work in FF,"This is not a problem with the actual script its self, it works fine for me locally and in Safari.

The issue for me is with pressing the example button on http://prinzhorn.github.com/jquery-inlog/ - it doesn't work under FF9.0.1 (or, less importantly, IE9).

In FF I just get: 

$.inlog is not a function
[Break On This Error] $.inlog(true); 

and jquery.inlog.js doesn't seem to have loaded at all.

In IE9 I get a bit more info:

SEC7112: Script from https://raw.github.com/Prinzhorn/jquery-inlog/master/jquery.inlog.js was blocked due to mime type mismatch 
jquery-inlog

which gives me the impression that the

Support DOM Nodes in Formatter besides plain HTML Text.,"My team has been trying out SlickGrid and we are very impressed by the features and performance.

We ran into some issue where we are interested in appending some DOM Nodes into cells.

The options we tried out,
1. Formatter - Issue supports HTML Text that is appended using innerHTML - so we are have trouble associating events and are confined to working with string and some unpleasant workarounds.
2. Editors – The issue with Editors is that it allows only one editor to be visible at a time in SlickGrid (and I understand this is for a good reason.

I am recommending supporting a feature where a formatter method may return a String (as present) OR a DOM Node. So instead of the lines of code like the one below in slick.grid.js,

```
cellNode.innerHTML = getFormatter(row, column)(......)
```

We could have,

```
setFormattedValueInCell(cellNode, getFormatter(row, column)(......));
```

Where the new function setFormattedValueInCell could use innerHTML if it is a string OR use cellNode.appendChild when a domNode is passed in.

We had a brief forum discussion on the issue post which we checked some parts of the code – Forum reference - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8980826/slickgrid-editable-grid-with-controls-visible-by-default

[nano] Implement Support for Document Update Handlers,"Hello,

I would like to implement support for CouchDb Document Update Handlers.

[http://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/Document_Update_Handlers](http://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/Document_Update_Handlers)

My thoughts are implementing a new function called update_doc:

``` javascript
   /*
    * calls document update handler
    *
    * @param {design_name:string} design document namd
    * @param {update_name:string} update method to call
    * @param {doc_name:string} document name to update
    * @param {params:object} additions to the querystring
   */   
  function update_doc(design_name, update_name, doc_name, params, callback) {
     if(typeof params === ""function"") {
       callback = params;
       params = {};
     }
     var update_path = '_design/' + design_name + '/_update/' + update_name + '/' + doc_name;
     return relax({db: db_name, path: update_path, method: ""PUT"", params: params}, callback);
   }
```

Then a public db alias called ""update""

``` javascript
  public_functions.update = update_doc;
```
## usage

This should provide the ability to easily execute atomic updates on the couchdb server:

Document Update Handler in Design Document called my_design_doc:

``` javascript
""updates"": {
  ""in-place"" : ""function(doc, req) {
      var field = req.query.field;
      var value = req.query.value;
      var message = 'set '+field+' to '+value;
      doc[field] = value;
      return [doc, message];
  }""
}
```

Then using nano:

``` javascript
@db.update(""my_design_doc"", ""in-place"", ""<doc_name>"", { field: ""foo"", value: ""bar"" }, function(e,b) { console.log(b); }); 
```

Added some more items.,"Two things came up during the physical prototype testing that I thought it was important we address, so I added them to the rubric:

1 - There was a slight difficulty in communicating how to play and explaining the point system. So we need to make sure the player finds it easy to learn and understand the rules and scoring system.

2 - Some of the different rule sets and scoring systems had inherent bias. For example, at one point playing to get suits was far easier and more worth it than trying to get 4 of a kind. And when the rules were changed so players didn't have to pick up a card at the end of the round, a player could get an easy advantage by controlling the pace of the game by choosing to take a card every time anyway. We should try to balance the game as much as possible.

Facebook Sharing - Popup Dialog (FBDialog) no longer showing,"I recently updated to ShareKit 2.0 from the version you install from getsharekit.com, and now the Facebook sharing is terrible.  The first time I migrated to v2.0, it was redirecting me to the FB app, which I really didn't want to do.  However, I messed something up in my project, so I had to re-migrate.  Now, I'm getting a big white background that looks just like the default Twitter sharing when not using iOS 5.

How can I make the Facebook sharing show the pop-up dialog again, rather than the ugly plain modal view or redirecting to the FB app?  I don't want to use the SHKFormControllerLargeTextField.

The cat says <span id=""cat"">?</span>.
The dog says <span id=""dog"">?</span>.

And the server

```
var connect = require('connect');
var dnode = require('dnode');

var server = connect.createServer();
server.use(connect.static(__dirname));

dnode(function (client) {
    this.cat = function (cb) {
        cb('meow ');
    };
    this.dog = function (cb) {
        cb('bau ');
    };

}).listen(server);

server.listen(6857);
console.log('http://localhost:6857/');
```

This is an example: I should call cat and dog in different point of app.

`SWTException: Invalid thread access` on OSX,"Hey ashbb!

Cool stuff you got going on here!  I've just stopped by to report my experience testing this on OSX 10.7.

Here's what I did to get things started, rvm style.

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/ashbb/purple_shoes.git
cd purple_shoes
echo ""rvm jruby@purple_shoes --create"" > .rvmrc
cd . # get rvm to pick up rvmrc and create gemset
gem install swt
cd samples/
jruby --1.9 sample.rb
```

And here's the output I get:

```
objc[18116]: Object 0x7fbc9203c8c0 of class __NSArrayM autoreleased with no pool in place - just leaking - break on objc_autoreleaseNoPool() to debug

NativeException: org.eclipse.swt.SWTException: Invalid thread access

```

Googling for ""Display must be created on main thread due to Cocoa restrictions."", I found recommendations to try adding `-XstartOnFirstThread` as a JVM arg.  I tried sticking this onto the jruby arguments--as it seems to have support for `-X` options--but I got the exact same output.

The SWT FAQ does have an entry on this exception, though I haven't yet delved deep enough to figure out how that answer might apply here:

http://www.eclipse.org/swt/faq.php#uithread

So there's a bit of OSX testing for you.  Sorry I couldn't report better news!  Hopefully we can figure out what's going on here and it'll be smooth sailing after that.

Composer exports overwrite the Classes and export static instances,"https://github.com/lyonbros/composer.js/blob/master/composer.js#L1628

If I am reading this correctly, there is a scoped class, eg, `Model` and you are exporting not the class itself but an instance of the class instead here. This makes the instantiation option overloading in `Model::initialize` with data etc totally inaccessible to the `Composer.Model` export, which remains the static object. 

Is this intended?

Localization issues,"Hi, 

There are a few places where you should take into consideration the current locale in order to get the correct value for  parameters. For example, the current unit tests fail at 3 points when using double or decimal types with a system where the decimal separator is a "","" (coma) instead of a ""."" (period).

The following tests:
ParseAcceptHeader_MultipleTypesAndPriorities_FindsCorrectTypesAndPriorities
ParseAcceptHeader_SingleTypeAndPriority_FindsCorrectTypeAndPriority
HttpPOST_WithAllParameterSources_CallsHandlerPostMethodAndReturnsCorrectData

Are the ones that fail immediately, these can be fixed quite easily by replacing:

method: Extensions.ParseAcceptHeader 

From:
  mimeTypes.Add(preferenceParts.ElementAt(0), Convert.ToDouble(preferenceParts.ElementAt(1).Substring(2)));
To:
  mimeTypes.Add(preferenceParts.ElementAt(0), Convert.ToDouble(preferenceParts.ElementAt(1).Substring(2), CultureInfo.InvariantCulture));

And

method: ArgumentBuilder.changeType

From: 
  return Convert.ChangeType(value, conversionType);
To:
  return Convert.ChangeType(value, conversionType, CultureInfo.InvariantCulture);

Nice framework over all. Good work :)

Setup is not exactly straightforward,"The most likely cause of this is my total ignorance of PHP Namespaces, but when I followed the instructions and did the following:

``` php

```

I got the following error:

```
Fatal error: Class 'Everyman\Neo4j\Client' not found in XXX.php on line YYY
```

After this, I tried to stick the source-code in a folder called `lib` in the root of my project, and the following code works perfectly:

``` php
<?php

    spl_autoload_register(""autoload"");

    use Everyman\Neo4j\Client,
        Everyman\Neo4j\Transport;

    $client = new Client(new Transport('localhost', 7474));
    print_r($client->getServerInfo());

    function autoload($file)
    {
        $base = dirname(__FILE__).""/lib"";
        $filename = str_replace('\\', DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR, $file) . '.php';
        if(file_exists($base.DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR.$filename))
            require_once($base.DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR.$filename);
    }

?>
```

I think it might be a far smaller barrier to entry if you were to include an example like this in your wiki - that is, if I didn't totally miss something fundamental with the `phar` example.

Reapparance of meltdown after deleting cookies,"Unrelated to this project I happened to delete all of my browser's cookies in Chrome. When I returned to testing the project that uses session.js (latest release of course), however, I started getting all kinds of errors such as:

@line 371

Just checked this in Firefox and the same thing is happening there too after I delete all cookies there. The session cookie is re-created in both browsers but the location cookie is not re-created.

This is an issue that I thought was fixed a couple of patches back. Maybe it only appeared to be fixed and has simply become more apparent now.

Email notifications for collaborator commits,"_Happy new Year to all of you_

You might have noticed that something is missing in the current briefing of organization members. There are no email-notifications for commits and keeping track of real changes is difficult, especially for larger organizations or being a member of some, as you have to check in to the website permanentely. (There are commit hooks, and one of them is email, but only one email address can be provided, users can't choose to listen or not, like all the other notifications.) Commits show up only in the news feed or by adding a comment to each pushed commit. First is bad as you have email and/or news feed to look up for; the Second expects some extra work by any pushing collaborator.

There have been others wishing this feature, like:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/552360/git-push-email-notification
which leads to some scripts enabling commit notifications. (there are more out there)

As I am still far away to understand all the official or hidden gems of gitting, I started to know about Git having a way to fire off custom scripts when certain important actions occur. There are two groups of these hooks: client side and server side. The client-side hooks are for client operations such as committing and merging. The server-side hooks are for Git server operations such as receiving pushed commits. 

In our case we need to use something like the server-side POST-recieve Hook to execute a commit mailing list script, right? 
This has to be filled with all push/pull collaborator email adresses, unless someone does not want it and off we go.
The script can be be customized to show more or less detailed commit statements.

Is that possible, Garvin?  Is it worth to add it to s9y/repo org? And are all other Collaborators willing to have that?

"IE8 and below: ""invalid argument""","I'm not sure if this is really a bug or not, as it suddenly appeared one day. The component was working fine on IE before. I re-copied the component code so it should be up to date and untouched. 

I've run into a situation where IE7-IE8 (probably older ones also, haven't tested) return ""invalid argument"". With some testing it seems like the failure happens inside  ins(parent, child1, child2)-function at

```
parent.insertBefore(child1, child2||null);
```

when child2 has a value other than null (on IE8). When error appears, values of the parameters (outerHTML) are for
parent (first and last gt/lt-signs removed as otherwise the example is hidden): 

```
<roundrect style=""FILTER: progId:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Blur(pixelradius=2,makeshadow=1,shadowopacity=.3); WIDTH: 11px; HEIGHT: 4px; TOP: -2px; LEFT: 10px"" arcsize=""1""></roundrect>
```

child1: 

```
<fill opacity=""0.25"" color=""#FFFFFF""></fill>
```

child2: 

```
<stroke opacity=""0""></stroke
```

What came to mind first was is it sure the parent contains the child2? insertBefore without the second parameter works fine.

Bug: Compass Error output doesn't appear in CSS file.,"Hello Kris,

I spoke to you recently on Stack Overflow about an issue I was having: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8771747/asseticbundle-compassfilter-any-way-to-throw-an-exception-when-a-template-can

You kindly allowed me to post an issue on github so I did a bit more digging before doing so to try and narrow my issue down - and I have also come up with a fix (maybe?).

**The Problem:**
After you told me that Assetic could not generate the Symfony2 exception page when it failed to generate an asset you mentioned that Assetic should dump the exception to the generated CSS file - this is true but my issue then became that the stacktrace in the CSS file did not contain the Compass process's output.

To demonstrate I purposefully made a faulty `_forms.scss` file whereby I missed a `$` symbol on the variable `span` in the `mixin` named `form-element`:

```
$form-column-width: $grid-column-width;

@mixin form-column($span) {
    width: $form-column-width * $span;
}

@mixin form-element($span) {
    width: ($form-column-width * span) - 20;
}
```

Compiling this file on the command line yielded the following (the error message being the ""process output"" that I was wanting to appear in the generated CSS file:

```
compass compile .
directory ./stylesheets/
    error sass/single.scss (Line 8: Undefined operation: ""40px times span"".)
```

However the generated CSS file contained a stacktrace without this error message:

```

                    in /var/www/egd/web/app_dev.php line 21
```

And the relevant message also did not appear using the assetic:dump command (note that the error output here errors out on `login.css` because the faulty `_forms.scss` is a ""partial"" which is included in `login.scss`):

```
php app/console assetic:dump

Dumping all dev assets.
Debug mode is on.

[file+] /var/www/egd/app/../web/bundles/egdsecurity/css/login.css

[RuntimeException]

assetic:dump [--watch] [--force] [--period=""...""] [write_to]
```

**The Solution:**
After looking at the stacktrace I navigated to `CompassFilter.php` line `278` to find the following line:

`throw new \RuntimeException($proc->getErrorOutput() ?: $proc->getOutput());`

Which I found that if I modified to become:

`throw new \RuntimeException($proc->getOutput());`

Gave me almost the correct output in the generated CSS file:

```
[exception] 500 | Internal Server Error | RuntimeException
[message] [31m[0m[31m    error[0m assetic_compassVCz3tJ.scss (Line 16: Undefined operation: &quot;40px times span&quot;.)
[32m   create[0m assetic_compassVCz3tJ.css 

[1] RuntimeException: [31m[0m[31m    error[0m assetic_compassVCz3tJ.scss (Line 16: Undefined operation: &quot;40px times span&quot;.)
[32m   create[0m assetic_compassVCz3tJ.css

// Rest of the Stacktrace was removed.
```

**Please note** that this second CSS dump was made with a different version of `_forms.scss` since my codebase moved forward but I put the same error into it. The only issue with the error dump is that compass reports the Assetic copied filename but that isn't really an issue for me - some error output is better than none.

I don't know if other users have the same issue as me so perhaps other people would like to pitch in - my Sass & Compass path is different from default as I noted in my Stack Overflow post:

```
assetic:
    debug:          %kernel.debug%
    use_controller: false
    sass: /var/lib/gems/1.8/bin/sass
    filters:
        compass:
          bin: /var/lib/gems/1.8/bin/compass
          apply_to: ""\.scss$""
        scss: ~
```

Lastly I apologise that it's such a long post, I hope it helps though. Also, thank you for making such a great tool, it certainly comes in very handy and definitely helps streamline development.

Kind Regards,
Kasheen

Slow scrolling,"Hi there, 

it seems the last update has some kind of regression. 
With version 1.2.1.3 rif had suddenly a lot smoother scrolling. Many users confirmed this.

Sadly with the latest update (version 1.2.1.5) it went in the wrong direction again. Scrolling is laggy and slow now, no matter what settings i use. It is definitely a problem with the latest version because changing back to an old version fixes the issue.

Thx

Options for reporting genotypes.,"Currently, we can do the following:

```
>>> for sample in record.samples:
...     print sample['GT']
'1|2'
'2|1'
'2/2'
```

It would be nice to have a built in method that looks at the ref and alt alleles and converts the encoded genotypes into DNA alleles (GTS == genotypes using Sequence).

```
>>> for sample in record.samples:
...     print sample['GTS']
'A|C'
'C|A'
'C/C'
```

Also, an option that returns the standard numeric encoding for genotypes: 0 == hom_ref, het == 1, hom_alt == 2, unknown (./.) == -1. This would allow one to easily compute useful popgen statistics such as HWE, pi_hat, and conduct multi-dimensional scaling comparisons.

```
>>> for sample in record.samples:
...     print sample['GTN']
1
2
0 
-1
etc.
```

Crash in FB and Twitter sharing in iOS 4.3 Simulator,"I'm converting my iOS 5 app to work with iOS 4.x as well, and by FB and Twitter sharing are not working.  Admittedly, I have customized the views, so I thought it might be something I'm doing.  However, I can consistently reproduce the crash with a new repository clone in the example ShareKit app.

Step to Reproduce:
1. Clone ShareKit repository
2. Launch the sample ShareKit project.
3. Select ShareKit > iPhone 4.3 Simulator scheme.
4. Run the app.
5. Select ""Sharing Text""
6. Select the share button and choose Facebook
7. Log in and approve app for Facebook use
8. Touch inside the text view to select some of the text.
9. See the Crash

Repeating the steps above replacing Facebook with Twitter produces the same results.
Repeating the steps above for both Facebook and Twitter, but selecting iOS 5 instead works just fine, no crash, no issues.

In fact, just tried it sharing Email as well, and same result.
