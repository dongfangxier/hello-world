second fix would be in all the opt/vc/include/interface/vcos/vcos*.h:

- \+ #include ""pthreads/vcos_platform.h""

but being the lazy fool that i am i just copied the files from the pthreads subfolder there, after noticing that grep gave me to many files to fix that in :-P

i guess this would be just a very dirty fix because noone else reported it yet, and so might even be fixed by some makefile magic or the like in the quake3 repository? i can't imagine this problem to be a global one, probably also just tied to quake3+raspbian?
(i use the raspbian-r3.img from hexxeh)

Popups can not be defined outside the page they're used in.,"I'm not sure if this is a bug or the intended behavior, but at the very least it's inconsistent with the way dialogs work and rather limiting in the way it can be used. I'm hoping somebody can chime in and let me know what they think about this issue.

When building dialogs, I can put the dialog DIV outside the page DIV that uses it:

```
<div data-role=""page"" id=""home"">
    <div data-role=""header"">...</div>
    <div data-role=""content"">
        <a href=""#dialog"" data-role=""button"" data-rel=""dialog"">dialog</a>
    </div>
    <div data-role=""footer"">...</div>
</div>
....
<div data-role=""dialog"" id=""dialog"">
    ...
</div>
```

This allows me to pre-load all my static dialogs into a single HTML page, and then pull content DIVs which use those dialogs via AJAX. However, this same technique doesn't work with popups. The following code doesn't display the popup when the button is clicked:

```
<div data-role=""page"" id=""home"">
    <div data-role=""header"">...</div>
    <div data-role=""content"">
        <a href=""#popup"" data-role=""button"" data-rel=""popup"">popup</a>
    </div>
    <div data-role=""footer"">...</div>
</div>
....
<div data-role=""popup"" id=""popup"">
    ...
</div>
```

In order to get the popup to render, I need to put its DIV _inside_ the page DIV that it will be rendered on:

```
<div data-role=""page"" id=""home"">
    <div data-role=""popup"" id=""popup"">
        ...
    </div>
    <div data-role=""header"">...</div>
    <div data-role=""content"">
        <a href=""#popup"" data-role=""button"" data-rel=""popup"">popup</a>
    </div>
    <div data-role=""footer"">...</div>
</div>
```

This has two implications:
1. I can't have multiple pages use the same popup -- I have to create multiple identical copies of the popup, one for each page.
2. I can't pull in the DIV for  a new page via AJAX unless I also include all popup DIVs that the page might use.

Here are some fiddles for testing:

Ability to generate csv file with aggregated results,"Today, Gatling generate only an html report with some computed numbers and mostly with Charts.
I need to gather most of the computed numbers of several runs to put it in another tool (a spreadsheet for exemple) for historization but mostly to be able to compare different runs results.

Today, doing such things is very painful (copy/past from orange box statistics)  or impossible (all computed numbers in graphics)

Could you provide some configuration parameters to generate raw computed numbers in a format like csv ?

Your current html report is cool but clearly insufficient for more advanced usage.

Thanks in advance

"Doc issue: Clarify ""depends"" and ""param"" properties in rules","After a good read of the primary docs (http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation and http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation/Reference), I didn't find any clear overview of using the depends parameter in the rules collection.
The big challenge here is knowing that when you use ""depends"", you need to use ""param"" to host the parameters. That is unclear and deserves a topic in the docs.

For example:

``` js
$(""#TextBox1"").rules(""add"", {
   range: {
      param : [1, 10],
      depends : ""#CheckBox1""
   }
}
```

It would help to have a topic on one of these pages focused on dependencies. That topic would discuss the syntax issue related to using ""param"" as shown.

Auto-enable mobile data network,"Hi, this is a feature request, not a real issue.

Prey should be able to auto-connect to mobile data network upon activation.

Imagine you lost your phone in a place without wifi (happens to me all the time). Chances are that a mobile network is available, since it is almost omnipresent these days.

According to this thread (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8354530/how-to-enable-data-connection-on-android-2-3) it is possible to programmatically enable/disable mobile network without user intervention on android up to 2.3 (probablly any android version too).

PS: Sorry for not submiting a patch. Right now I'm on a trip with no access to my development environment.

Spel Implicit Map [SPR-9472],"**[Ben Hubbard](https://jira.spring.io/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=hubbaba)** opened **[SPR-9472](https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-9472?redirect=false)** and commented

It doesn't appear possible to define an implicit map using spel.  It would be nice to have a map syntax similar to groovy but using the curly braces like spel already uses for implicit lists.  Something like this:

{'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}
or
{key1: 'value1', key2: 'value2'}

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10850863/wicked-pdf-jquery-css-zeba-style-table-body-only-rails-3-2-3-and-where-to-pl

There doesn't seem to be an example that is up-to-date for the asset pipeline from my extensive googling around this gem.

I'd be happy to help build an up-to-date example app that could act as a demo of all the major features with help from the community.

Thanks

This is a little bit gnarly in that it depends upon my fork of [M2Crypto](http://chandlerproject.org/Projects/MeTooCrypto) -- the reason is that Ubuntu's builds of OpenSSL omit support for SSLv2 and stock M2Crypto builds fail to build there. My lightly modified version deals with this better. I will submit the patch upstream, but I have submitted patches in the past and haven't gotten a response, so I am not too hopeful that it will get into the official version anytime soon.

"adding detach, for alternate view removal","Prompted by this question:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11073877/delegateevents-in-backbone-js/11074013#11074013

It can be confusing that just by calling `.remove()`, all bound events are lost from the view element, even when the cached `$el` still exists on the view, appearing to indicate that it should contains all previously bound events. jQuery (1.4+) provides `.detach()` for these cases where you may want to temporarily remove the view without losing bindings on the element.

If anything, it would be helpful to include in the documentation that calling `remove` will remove all delegated events as well.

An alternate approach could be to change `.remove()` to be `.remove([bool])`, where a true value indicates that jQuery data is to be maintained and calla `.detach` rather than `.remove`

---

Edit: just checked and there doesn't appear to be an equivalent zepto method to `.detach`, so the `.remove([bool])` might be a better option

Fix CLEAN_VIRTUALENV usage so it actually works.,"Purging the venv using the labs user_env_compile feature with the CLEAN_VIRTUALENV env var doesn't work: since commit 6aadf1683a2e2a3f9cca1ea90cf74bf809214328 VIRTUALENV_DIRS is unassigned, so nothing gets deleted.

I made the distinction between legacy- and modern-style virtualenvs. You may not want to merge this as-is because it will move legacy-venv from /app to /app/.heroku/venv and the user will have to update PYTHONHOME.
Does bin/release force PYTHONHOME to /app/.heroku/venv/ ? In this case we don't want any legacy venv and this commit is ok.

In fact I had the opposite problem after trying to purge my virtualenv with the purge branch (as documented here: http://stackoverflow.com/a/9463068/343834), the venv was moved to /app from /app/.heroku/venv and it broke my app by not being anymore in PYTHONHOME. If you have access to heroku support requests it's the #54723.

add callback being fired multiple times,"This should not be an issue with the plugin but in my use of the plugin. Any thoughts/pointers about how to debug this would be great. 

Here's the situation: 

I am displaying the upload plugin in a modal window. The user uploads the files - As the file uploads are progressing, the modal container window is hidden and we display a separate progress window instead. 

If the uploads are all successful, we close the modal window (This works well without any issues). 
In case there was an error with uploading one or more files, we show the upload window again. If I try to add another file using the file input now, the file gets added twice (or thrice, or four times or more - depending on how many times we show the upload window again after receiving a server error on uploading files). 

I am not quite sure about where the issue is. I hope I have described the issue adequately.

"On pressing backspace+Enter, keep cursor indent","When I want to ""exit"" a block of code while writing it, I press `<backspace>`. For example, I'm writing this:

``` coffee
if foo
  bar
  # cursor
```

When I press backspace, I'll get something like this:

``` coffee
if foo
  bar
# cursor
```

But then, I want to leave some space after the block, so I hit `<enter>`. The result is that the indent of the new line is set to the one of the last non-blank line:

``` coffee
if foo
  bar

  # cursor
```

While this seems to be a minor issue, it trips me up all the time. I suppose I should get used to leaving the space _first_ with an `<enter>`, but I can't seem to do so :). In python, the behaviour is exactly as I want it to be, so I took a cue from that indent file and I tweaked this one to work like that.

I understand there may be some specific reason to have it this way. If so, I have no complaints to rejecting this PR outright.

- Consistent use of quotes in HTML
- Consistent color values in CSS

- Always use closing tags
- Use common DOCTYPE capitalization

Steps toward reducing the number of repeat issues we get around many of these things and improve diff/cat readability.

Also aiming to work towards ensuring that HTML5 Boilerplate can continue to be used with ""no surprises"" by web app/site developers and more specialized web app boilerplates/toolkits. I think the future of the project is as much to provide a starting point for web app boilerplate/toolkit developers as it is to be a resource for beginners to learn from. In keeping with that, I'm open to any adaptation of the project that can help make it even more useful for those developers.

Thanks.

So, I have an api  using methodview, in a separate file which I import to my app and register there, and I've stripped this to the basics just to attempt a working version

```

      @task(name=""get_task"")
      def get_resource(tag):

Show and hide controls with mousemove / Select 'Off' in subtitles menu by default,"Whoops, I intended these to be separate but it looks like all of my updates have been combined into one pull request now. Here's some info, I hope these are helpful!

1) Show and hide controls with mousemove (src/controls.js, src/lib.js)
I'm just now noticing that you have a new fullscreen events branch, so maybe this is redundant. No hard feelings if you don't want to use my update. Previously, the player would show the control bar whenever the mouse is hovering over the player, and since the mouse is always hovering over the player while in fullscreen mode, the controls would always be visible then. So I've replaced that with a new method involving mousemove events. To sum up, every time the mouse is moved over the player, the control bar fades in and then a timed event is set to fade out the control bar after 1.5 seconds. I left a lot of comments in the code so there's more explanation in there. Unfortunately I wasn't able to test this in IE8 and below since 3.2.2 seems broken in IE8 and below at the moment, but it seems to work well with everything else.

UPDATED: I fixed a rather obvious shortcoming with yesterday's code: touch devices weren't being accounted for. So I've added a new isTouchDevice() check to lib.js to ensure that non-iOS devices can be tested for, which uses the latest detection from Modernizr (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4817029/whats-the-best-way-to-detect-a-touch-screen-device-using-javascript) and if that returns true, then the control bar is always shown just like the player's previous behavior for tablets. I've only tested this on an iPad (1st gen) so far but this should work in theory for Android tablets, Windows tablets, etc.

2) Select 'Off' in subtitles menu by default (src/tracks.js)
I thought it was a little weird that nothing in the subtitles menu is selected by default, and that you can then click to select 'Off' if you want but nothing changes. The menu already effectively defaults to 'Off' so this just confirms it.

plugin does not work in phonegap 1.9 [android],"I was able to get everything to compile when I replaced

``` java
this.ctx.runOnUiThread(runnable);
```

with

``` java
this.ctx.getActivity().runOnUiThread(runnable);
```

in ConnectPlugin, but the app crashed when I started it up. It's possible something other than the above was the cause of my crash.. but at any rate, it looks like they're not letting us call runOnUiThread the same way as before.

Everything seems to work just fine on iPhone, though, so far, in case you haven't gotten that up and tested yet :)

_Edit_: scratch that, we ended up having issues with 1.9 on older versions of iPhone, in case anyone's curious.. so we're still a 1.8.1 house

unique has_many association with pagination breaks,"We are facing a problem using the latest version (master) of sqlserver-adapter and will_paginate. Our model has a unique has_many association. Paginating this relation results in invalid sql.

The following example is completely fictional and makes no sense at all but it should illustrate the situation. I can't use the real code and I had to replace the sql-statements so they really don't mean anything.

``` ruby
class Article
   has_many(:comment_authors,
           :order => 'created_at')

  has_many(:collaborators,
           :class_name => 'User',
           :through => :comment_authors,
           :uniq => true)
end
```

accessing the relation works as expected:

``` ruby
Article.find(200).collaborators.to_sql 
# => SELECT DISTINCT [collaborators].* FROM [collaborators] INNER JOIN [comment_authors] ON [collaborators].[article_id] = [comment_authors].[article_id] WHERE [comment_authors].[article_id] = 237
```

when I add pagination it breaks:

``` ruby
Article.find(200).collaborators.paginate(:page => 1).to_sql 
# => SELECT TOP (15) [__rnt].* FROM ( SELECT ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY [collaborators].[article_id] ASC) AS [__rn], DISTINCT [collaborators].* FROM [collaborators] INNER JOIN [tblTeam] ON [collaborators].[article_id] = [comment_authors].[article_id] WHERE [comment_authors].[article_id] = 237 ) AS [__rnt] WHERE [__rnt].[__rn] > (0) ORDER BY [__rnt].[__rn] ASC
```

The code above results in the following exception:

```
ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid: TinyTds::Error: Incorrect syntax near the keyword 'DISTINCT'.: EXEC sp_executesql N'SELECT TOP (15) [__rnt].* FROM ( SELECT ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY [collaborators].[article_id] ASC) AS [__rn], DISTINCT [collaborators].* FROM [collaborators] INNER JOIN [comment_authors] ON [collaborators].[article_id] = [comment_authors].[article_id] WHERE [comment_authors].[article_id] = 237 ) AS [__rnt] WHERE [__rnt].[__rn] > (0) ORDER BY [__rnt].[__rn] ASC'

npyio.py --> recfromcsv seems to have a bug that ignores any dtypes provided,"I found this due to [someone's problem loading large integers with recfromcsv](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11064908/getting-numpy-overflow-despite-declaring-dtype-int64/11065583#comment14481167_11065583). After playing with it, I think it is simply ignoring all the dtype information provided.

[Line 1859 in npyio.py, part of recfromcsv()](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/numpy/lib/npyio.py#L1859) tries to either bring in the dtypes passed or set None. However, it actually brings in a kwarg that I couldn't find anywhere else called 'update' which looks suspiciously like a copied mistype from earlier in the line. If I change 'update' --> 'dtype', then the types get picked up as expected. More explicitly, in recfromcsv, change:

`kwargs.update(dtype=kwargs.get('update', None),`

to this:

`kwargs.update(dtype=kwargs.get('dtype', None),`

"RoR 3.x.x: Postgres adapter, no way to set character varying without limitation","Hi all,

In RoR 3.x.x: Postgres adapter, has no way to set character varying without limitation. Before when RoR 2.8.x sets a migration with  a string field without limitation, like:

``` ruby
t.string :alternate_names
```

This migration will generate next command, that will create the field without character varying limitation.

``` sql
ALTER TABLE geo_names ADD COLUMN alternate_names character varying;
```

But in RoR 3.x.x no way to do it, you can generate a migration with not limit character varying, always sets (255) limit by default.

``` sql
ALTER TABLE geo_names ADD COLUMN alternate_names character varying(255);
```

If for some reason it's is need that defaults limits be set to 255, we need some alternative for sets migrations without limitations on  character varying.  Perhaps changes on postgres adapter that could allow leaving it blank for default or explicitly by setting nil for avoid limit (or viceversa)

``` ruby
t.string :alternate_names, :limit => nil
```

Best,

Add option to skip count query to support really large datasets,"Hi,

If you run quite complex query on really large data sets it might take a long time to finish the count query.

It would be great if there would be an option that sets paging to infinite, which basically means:
- do not perform count query
- do not show link to a last page (because you do not know anymore)
- change page_entries_info to support infinite mode

Weird behaviour using joins,"This is not an issue but it's rather a question. Since I don't know whether this is a MagicaRecord bug, iOS bug, Core Data bug or me making mistakes (this is sure) I would like to ask here since you know things better.

This happened after installing the latest iOS version (the beta one) and I don't know whether it worked correctly on the previous version.

This is the workflow:
- I use _always_ the MR_contextForCurrentThread to create and fetch resources in my background thread
- The thread is mainly a loop cycle. At each interaction I call the MR_save method (also on the MR_contextForCurrentThread)
- When the thread has done, the user can tap on the UI and get another view controller to be presented
- This new VC fetches (therefore from the main thread, thus another context) the resources which should have been created
  by the aforementioned thread.

What happens:
- The set of resources is empty
- If I completely close the application, I reopen it and I tap the view to get the VC, every works just fine.

A small ugly workaround I found is to issue `[[NSManagedObjectContext MR_defaultContext] reset]` right before opening the VC (therefore fetching the objects from the main thread).

More specifically:
`Company` and `Family` are two `NSManagedObject`.

```
company = [Company MR_findFirstByAttribute:@""name"" withValue:@""company_name""];
```

and its content:

>    <Company: 0xa3cc110> (entity: Company; id: 0x978ccc0 x-coredata:///Company/tD12DB62B-CF31-4143-87BA-1978FB9266EF2 ; data: {
>    families =     (
>        ""0xa4c0710 x-coredata:///Family/tD12DB62B-CF31-4143-87BA-1978FB9266EF74"",
>        ""0x978eaa0 x-coredata:///Family/tD12DB62B-CF31-4143-87BA-1978FB9266EF3""
>    );
>    name = company_name;
>    })

Notice the two Family objects.
Next I want to retrieve all the Family objects tied with such Company:

```
- (NSArray *) familiesInCompany:(Company *) company {
    NSPredicate *predicate1 = [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@""company == %@"", company];
    NSPredicate *predicate2 = [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@""company.name == %@"", company.name];

    NSArray *first = [Family MR_findAllSortedBy:@""name"" ascending:YES withPredicate:predicate1];
    NSArray *second = [Family MR_findAllSortedBy:@""name"" ascending:YES withPredicate:predicate2];
    NSArray *third = [Family MR_findByAttribute:@""company"" withValue:company andOrderBy:@""name"" ascending:YES];

    return second;
}
```

What happens is the following:
- `first` is an empty array
- `second` contains the two Family objects (correct)
- `third` is an empty array

According to what the [Apple documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/Predicates/Articles/pUsing.html) states (the Joins paragraph), it is strongly suggested to use the way I used in the `first` experiment but it won't work. Still, if I close and reopen the application, all the three statements give the same result: an array with two entries.

Can someone shed a light on this? Thank you so much and sorry for the long post.

Faster log base 2 ceiling,"See: http://stackoverflow.com/a/10538937/365478

Replacing the portable if-statement method with the less portable gcc/clang built-in could result in significant global speedup. The lg_2 call happens at the core of the memory allocator so it is called frequently.

As mentioned in the StackOverflow conversation, the solution is mostly there but is not quite up to the standard for inclusion. It needs a minor rewrite.

It is also possible this change will have no significant effect. Profiling would be helpful.

Regression: Summary Type of custom function broken in jqGrid 4.4,"In prior versions of jqGrid, a function could be used as a custom summary type, as explained [here](http://www.trirand.com/jqgridwiki/doku.php?id=wiki%3agrouping&s%5B%5D=summarytype):

```
function myCustomSummary(val, name, record) {
    return totalSumRecord[name];
}

jQuery(""#grid"").jqGrid({

  colModel : [
     {..},
     {name:'myColumn',

      sorttype:'number',
      formatter:'number',
      summaryType:myCustomSummary},
     ...
  ],
  ...
});
```

Unfortunately this stopped working after upgrading to 4.4.0 - the line in `grid.grouping.js` was changed from `if(this.st == 'avg') {` to `if(this.st.toLowerCase() === 'avg') {`. The problem is that `this.st` ends up resolving to a function, so `st.toLowerCase()` is not defined.

One possible fix might be:

```
if(this.st.toLowerCase && this.st.toLowerCase() === 'avg') {
```

I think this fixes the problem but have not tested it.

Race condition when two Roots load at the same time: both fail to load,"**Originally by _archie172_**

___
Vaadin 7.0alpha2

I have an `Application` with multiple `Root`s that I load into different browser tabs. Usually I have two of these tabs open at once.

Often after restarting Tomcat, I will hit 'Reload' on both tabs at the same time to restart the `Application`.

However, there is a race condition in Vaadin, where it tries to start two instances of the `Application` at the same time.

The result is that neither works: see attached screenshots for what the failure looks like on each tab. One says `Invalid Security Key` and the other says `Session Expired`.

I have to reload the browser tabs again (one at a time) to get things working.

Nested forms not leveraging many-to-many,"# Case description

First of all, this issue is directly related with [#5325](https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/5325) and [#6161](https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/6161) a quick ref was posted also on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10717797/rails-nested-form-on-many-to-many-how-to-prevent-duplicates

I've setup a nested form in my rails 3.2.3 app, it's apparently working fine, my models are:

``` ruby
class Recipe < ActiveRecord::Base
  attr_accessible :title, :description, :excerpt, :date, :ingredient_lines_attributes

  has_and_belongs_to_many :ingredient_lines
  accepts_nested_attributes_for :ingredient_lines
end
```

and

``` ruby
class IngredientLine < ActiveRecord::Base
  attr_accessible :ingredient_id, :measurement_unit_id, :quantity

  has_and_belongs_to_many :recipes
  belongs_to :measurement_unit
  belongs_to :ingredient
end
```

As above, a `Recipe` can have multiple `IngredientLine` and vice versa.

What I'm trying to avoid is record duplication on `IngredienLine` table, which of course is the reason why I chose a many-to-many and not a one-to-many between `Recipe` and `IngredientLine`.

For example imagine that for `recipe_1` an `IngredientLine` with `{""measurement_unit_id"" => 1, ""ingredient_id"" => 1, ""quantity"" => 3.5}` is associated, if `for recipe_5` the `IngredientLine` child form is compiled by the user with the same values, I don't want a new record (with a different pk) on `IngredientLine` table, but only a new association record in the join table `ingredient_lines_recipes`.

Note that currently I don't have any `IngredientLine` controller as saving and updating `IngredientLines` is handled by nested form routines. Even my Recipe controller is plain and standard:

``` ruby
class RecipesController < ApplicationController
  respond_to :html

  def new
    @recipe = Recipe.new
  end

  def create
    @recipe = Recipe.new(params[:recipe])
    flash[:notice] = 'Recipe saved.' if @recipe.save  
    respond_with(@recipe)
  end

  def destroy
    @recipe = Recipe.find(params[:id])
    @recipe.destroy
    respond_with(:recipes)
  end

  def edit
    respond_with(@recipe = Recipe.find(params[:id]))
  end

  def update
    @recipe = Recipe.find(params[:id])
    flash[:notice] = 'Recipe updated.' if @recipe.update_attributes(params[:recipe])
    respond_with(@recipe)
  end

end
```
# Actual behaviour

With the code above, every time a user submit the nested form, a new record in `IngredientLine` is created, no matter if is identical to a previous one. This is not a many-to-many behaviour, it's a one-to-many behaviour.
# Present implementation

Looking at code, seems that join table records (relation) are created only when child object is a `new_record`, so fetching the existent record for `IngredientLine` with `first_or_create` won't solve the question since the new relation, with an existing object, won't be saved.
# My opinion

An elegant solution for this issue is directly related to the ability of using composite pk. When a child record is submitted by the user, the framework must know if it's already stored. Since pk is the way to check if a record is unique, and given that a common `id` pk value is not under user control, the best way is to set a composite pk from one or more fields submitted by the user.
Sticking with standard `id` pk could also be an option, but a list of fields to check for uniqueness must be explicitly specified for `first_or_create`.

Maybe I didn't explain very well.. in case just ask, thanks.

Add support for private repos through Github oAuth,"Hi Joachim,

I saw your request for adding support for private repos, so I took a shot at it. This branch allows updates from private repositories using an oAuth token, and it provides setup assistance through Plugins > Github Updater.

Once an application is setup and and a token is given, the WPGitHubUpdaterSetup class isn't needed anymore. The token will authorize updates on all sites from then on, and will allow the plugin author to revoke privileges in the future if they wish.

While in there, I noticed that in get_github_data(), wp_remote_get was being passed `$this->config['sslverify']` instead of `array( 'sslverify' => $this->config['sslverify'] )` so I changed that as well.

Hope this helps!

Paul Clark

PS: While fishing around in the github APIs, I noticed that they allow querying a repos tags, and the response gives all versions with zipball URLS:

https://api.github.com/repos/jkudish/WordPress-GitHub-Plugin-Updater/tags

Looks like the config values for api_url, raw_url, github_url, and zip_url could all be replaced by that one URL, and the readme would no longer need to include a version number (because they're listed in the tags). Thoughts?

Guard-shell executes twice,"I setup an example project with the following structure:

```
Gemfile
Guardfile
```

The contents of these files are:

```
# Gemfile
source :rubygems
gem ""guard""
gem ""guard-shell""
```

and

```
# Guardfile
guard 'shell' do
  watch(/^test\.txt$/) {|m| `echo #{m.inspect} #{File.mtime(m[0])}` }
end
```

I then continue to run guard. Whenever I echo something into that file, guard registers a change twice. In one shell:

```
$ echo blah >> test.txt
```

In the shell running guard:

```
> [test.txt] 2012-06-26 00:40:22 +0200
> [test.txt] 2012-06-26 00:40:22 +0200

The same behaviour accounts for vim/nano etc. Interestingly, when I just run echo blah > test.txt, guard only fires once.

Any idea how I can prevent this from happening or whether this is expected behaviour? (See my original stackoverflow question here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11198446/guard-executes-shell-scripts-twice)

Update Install-ChocolateyPackage to check for cached package installers,"The `Install-ChocolateyPackage` helper downloads package installers to a local temp directory. This patch adds a quick check to see if the file exists in the temp directory before downloading it again. This changes the temp file name to include the remote file name to help prevent name collisions between different versions of installers.

In this pull request, I also added the same local cache resolution strategy to the `Install-ChocolateyZipPackage` helper.

Some installers are rather large, and saving them helps save time and bandwidth, and possibly working towards a complete offline-accessible mode as discussed in Hanselman's blog post on working with NuGet offline.

This is my first Chocolatey pull request, so please let me know if there's anything else I should do to meet the project standards. Thanks for your patience from the other pull request.

Patch core initializer and user model to enable custom users with orders,"There's probably a much better way to do this, but this patch works and passes core tests.

If merged, this PR would require a slight tweak to the custom authentication instructions on http://ryanbigg.com/spree-guides/authentication.html

I.e., instead of directly setting Spree.user_class = ""User"" (or whatever the developer wants their custom user model to be), this PR would require a developer to set an environment var SPREE_USER_CLASS (in the same initializers/spree.rb file).

Net effect is that Spree::User becomes a sub-class of User (or whatever custom user model a developer specifies in initializers/spree.rb).  All the associations between Spree::Order and Spree::User are not touched at all -- because Spree::User is a subclass of User, the desired associations between Spree::Order and custom User are automatically applied by ActiveRecord.

POST vs PUT,"By definition POST should be used if you want to create a new resource to work on. In our case we know the resource (channel_id) and thus a PUT would be more appropriate.

```
POST creates a new resource, so POST to /items creates a resources that lives under the /items resource. Eg. /items/1
PUT is for creating or updating something with a known URL.
```

Using POST in conjunction with push_stream_authorized_channels_only should stay in place because you tell beforehand that you create the resource before anyone can access it. But the channel_id you want to create should set as a post variable ;)

`<font id=""FontAwesomeRegular"" horiz-adv-x=""1843"" >`

While CSS references:
`url('../font/fontawesome-webfont.svg#FontAwesome') format('svg');`

Correcting the font name makes it work in iPad.

Intermittent failures uploading to S3 - fog/excon related?,"We're stumped. I hope someone can help or point us in the right direction.

We recently upgraded our rails app to 3.2, taking carrierwave in the process from 0.5.7 to 0.6.2 and fog from 0.11.0 to 1.3.1.

Since then, we've been getting intermittent failures in uploading files to S3. We're hosted on ubuntu lucid machines on EC2 and the app is running ruby-enterprise-edition 1.8.7.

A successful upload logs something like this:

  Started POST ""/1/reports"" for .... at Sat Jun 30 08:35:20 +0000 2012
  Processing by Api::V1::ReportsController#create as JSON
  Parameters: {""image""=>#<ActionDispatch::Http::UploadedFile:0x6440998 @content_type=""image/jpeg"", @headers=""Content-    Disposition: form-data; name=\""report[image]\""; filename=\""reportimage\""\r\nContent-Type: image/jpeg\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: binary\r\n"", @original_filename=""reportimage"", @tempfile=#<File:/tmp/RackMultipart20120630-12529-cte3kr-0>>}}
  WARNING: Can't verify CSRF token authenticity
  Completed 201 Created in 1035ms (Views: 0.6ms)

It completes pretty quickly - never more than a second or two. File upload works, all good.

However, several times a day we get this instead (redactions mine):

  Excon::Errors::Forbidden (Expected(200) <=> Actual(403 Forbidden)
    request => {:instrumentor_name=>""excon"", :headers=>{""Authorization""=>""[REDACTED]"", ""x-amz-acl""=>""public-read"", ""Date""=>""Sat, 30 Jun 2012 08:35:21 +0000"", ""Content-Type""=>""image/jpeg"", ""Content-Length""=>144872, ""Host""=>""[REDACTED]""}, :write_timeout=>60, :mock=>false, :connect_timeout=>60, :path=>""[REDACTED]"", :expects=>200, :scheme=>""https"", :host=>""w[REDACTED]"", :retry_limit=>4, :query=>nil, :method=>""PUT"", :idempotent=>true, :body=>#File:/srv/tmp/20120630-0835-12529-8486/reportimage, :ssl_verify_peer=>true, :read_timeout=>60, :ssl_ca_file=>""/srv/.../shared/bundle/ruby/1.8/gems/excon-0.13.4/data/cacert.pem"", :port=>""443""}

It looks like the upload has been going on (or waiting to start) for 15 minutes and EC2 has finally replied with a 403 RequestTimeTooSkewed. The start of the request and this error are indeed fifteen minutes apart in the logs.

If users reattempt the upload, it will work a second time, again with a response time of under two seconds.

Anyone have an idea what's going on? We'd be very grateful for some help diagnosing this one.

Plack::handler::FCGI no html output under Windows,"Hello all,

I recently got issues running a Catalyst based application under IIS and the problem appeared to be linked to the Plack::Handler::FCGI found in version 0.9985 and later. In short, there's no output done as for some reasons stdout is not properly opened. When running the Catalyst script myapp_fastcgi.pl Iget the following kind of ouput in stead of html:

...
binmode() on unopened filehandle GEN2 at D:/perl/site/lib/Plack/Handler/FCGI.pm line 165, <DATA> line 998.
print() on unopened filehandle GEN2 at D:/perl/site/lib/Plack/Handler/FCGI.pm line 177, <DATA> line 998.
...

This behaviour can be replicated with the ""Hello"" example from Catalyst tutorials.

After reverting _only_ FGCI.pm to the version coming before 0.9985 there is no issue and myapp_fastcgi.pl returns properly formatted html.

From what I can tell via try & fail method, the error comes from this part of the module in 0.9985:

( .. some code ..)

@{$self}{qw(stdin stdout stderr)}
= (IO::Handle->new, IO::Handle->new, IO::Handle->new);

my %env;
my $request = FCGI::Request(

$self->{stdin}, $self->{stdout},
($self->{keep_stderr} ? $self->{stdout} : $self->{stderr}), \
%env, $sock,
($self->{nointr} ? 0 : &FCGI::FAIL_ACCEPT_ON_INTR),

( .. some more code ..)

I posted a bit more detail on StackOverflow when I was trying to figure out why I had problems (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10346847/catalyst-fcgi-myapp-fastcgi-pl-wont-work-under-windows-x64)

After posting this on the Plack google group, Miyagawa suggested to post here instead and adress this to Chansen (not sure how to, first time github user).

Windows .net build process,"Just wondering if we can work to get windows .net compatible build process up and running that can work with r.js.

Specifically, I want to be able to run my build process using the standard .net dependencies.  

A way of doing this might be to use one of the following Interpreters/Run Times to handle the interop between .net and executing the r.js script:
- http://jint.codeplex.com/
- http://javascriptdotnet.codeplex.com/
- http://jurassic.codeplex.com/

There maybe other ways of doing this, but the core concept is that a .net developer shouldn't have to install node/java just to get this build step running.

TIMOB-9379 initial push of Anvil driver for all platforms,"Test instructions for this are limited to running the driver against all 3 platforms to ensure that the test suites are executed properly.

Once node.js is installed, inside the support/driver directory run:
1) ""node driver.js --mode=local --platform=android""
2) once running and a android device is plugged in, input ""start""

Repeat the above steps for both iOS and Mobile Web.  For iOS, the simulator will be started.

*\* For mobile web, an Android device must be connected and seen by ADB but also the device must have access to the wifi network and be able to see the node.js web server being run by the driver.

backgrounded nohup processes don't always start (e.g. mysqld),"I've seen mysql not start, very very occasionally.  I could do with some help/advice!

I suspect it is due to the way we are nohupping and running SSH:

```
nohup mysqld & echo $! > pid.txt
```

What we observe it that the pid.txt file is created but pid not running.  There is no nohup.out and no indication of any problem in the log.

I wonder if it is related to the fact that we wait for ssh ""termination"" (in SshjTool eg ShellAction.create) by doing:

```
shell.join(TIMEOUT);
session.getExitStatus()
```

In particular we don't do session.join(TIMEOUT), which is advertised on the sshj API but not documented, so not sure.
But I suspect this is the cause of a difference in behaviour with command-line ssh, where:

```
ssh localhost 'nohup mysqld & echo $! > pid.txt ; exit 0'
```

Does _not_ return (until you've manually killed mysqld in a separate process).  Even though the _shell_ has exitted and
returned the exit code, I suspect the _session_ is kept open until std{in,out,err} are closed.  In particular if we add redirects:

```
ssh localhost 'nohup mysqld > out 2> err < /dev/null & echo $! > pid.txt ; exit 0'
```

The process _does_ return.  (See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29142 .)

Most tellingly, in the logs, when the mysqld problem happens, we do _not_ get the usual messages about output going to nohup.out.
So what I think is happening is that the script is proceeding to exit and the ssh session closed, while nohup is still starting,
causing nohup itself to be killed _before_ it has launched mysqld (ie before it has applied any nohupping).

Does this seem plausible?

If so I can see a few possible solutions:
- We just add a 'sleep 2' after any nohupped process
- We run:   nohup bash -c 'mysqld & echo $! > pid.txt'
  (causing the script not to proceed until bash has launched nohup.
  pid.txt may not be available immediately but that's okay as the subsequent scripts are forgiving.
  but means users have to code carefully for background processes.)
- We add the session.join(TIMEOUT), with a small timeout, say 10s,
  and warn if the session isn't ended in that time (to preserve compatibility),
  and encourage developers to write the following in their scripts:
  
  nohup mysqld > out 2> err < /dev/null &

I repeat it's rare (only 1 documented case) but potentially problematic so I think we should address it.
I think prefer the last option -- can't see anything that would break, and moves us to a better model.

Could do however with a sanity check, or better ideas!

README should teach how to run a single test class and example,"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1642034/how-to-run-a-single-shoulda-context-test-in-ruby-testunit-framework taught me how to run a single test class, and even a single test method, when Shoulda is being used.  This information should be kept with Shoulda itself!  To wit:
- To run a single Rails test class (in this example, a unit test; functional and integration tests are analogous):
  `rake test:units TEST=test/unit/order_mailer_test.rb`
- To run a single test method within a Rails test class:

```
rake db:test:prepare
ruby -I""lib:test"" path_to_test_file -n name_of_the_method
```

When using Shoulda, `name_of_the_method` would be, e.g., ""test: POST new while not logged in should contain the iframe and img tags. "" (including the trailing space!).
- To run test method(s) in a Rails test class whose names match a regular expression:

```
rake db:test:prepare
ruby -I""lib:test"" path_to_test_file -n /a_regexp/
```

When using Shoulda, `/a_regexp/` should uniquely identify the test, e.g., /POST new while not logged in should contain the iframe and img tags/

How to update dynamically on prototype,"Hi all,

I'm a total newbie to prototype (but have to use it). how can I update chosen.js dynamically on prototype. 

This is what I tried on my script

``` javascript
<script type=""text/javascript"">
      var spConfig = new Product.Config(<?php echo $this->getJsonConfig() ?>);

        var el = $$("".product-options select"");

        document.observe('dom:loaded', function(evt) {
             var select, selects, _i, _len, _results;
             if (Prototype.Browser.IE && (Prototype.BrowserFeatures['Version'] === 6 || Prototype.BrowserFeatures['Version'] === 7)) { return; }
             selects = el;  _results = [];
             for (_i = 0, _len = selects.length; _i < _len; _i++) {
                select = selects[_i];
                _results.push(new Chosen(select));
             }
        }); 

        el.invoke('observe', 'change', function() {
            spConfig.configureElement(el);
            Event.fire(el, ""liszt:updated"");
        });


   </script>
```

Everything works perfectly with that code, except that Event.fire line. Where I'm doing wrong here?

// sorry if this is not the right place to ask this question (considering this is actually an issue tracking tool), I've asked it on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11175016/update-prototype-chosen-js-dynamically but no response so far.

API for command.coffee functionality in CoffeeScript?,"CoffeeScript seems to be built around the concept of running the `coffee` bin. Even in Cakefiles, it appears the method for compiling coffee is by executing the `coffee` bin. This really limits anyone trying to compile coffeescript from within a restricted environment. In this case, restricted means that there is no access to `exec`, `Spawn`, etc.

So.. with that said, i looked in the code and saw that running is pretty straight forward. Simply call `require('coffee-script/lib/coffee-script/command').run()` and off you go! From here though, is where i ran into issues. I noticed that `run()` does not take any arguments. There for the only way to use `run()` is by hand setting `process.argv` ahead of time.. leading to something like this..

```
coffee_build = (args) ->
  argv = process.argv
  args[...0] = argv[0]
  process.argv = args
  coffee_command.run()
  process.argv = argv
```

Now this works fine for a single execution, but i ran into a problem when executing two calls to `coffee_build`. The issue seems to be that somewhere in CoffeeScript's code, async happens. This causes any number of calls to `run()` to use the **last set `process.argv`**. Some async, somewhere, asks process.argv for it's value, and due to the new code path caused by it's async branch, it gets the last set value.

Now.. this is all very hacky. I am very aware.. which is why i'm asking for help with the following two questions..
1. Is there a better API to handle compiling CoffeeScript, without access to `exec`, `Spawn`, etc?
2. If there is not.. any tips for doing what i am trying to do?

Error on deploy:assets:precompile task.,"I have a newly deploy rails app. Just done with `cap staging deploy:setup`.

```

While this same setup works for production environment. While debugging I just removed `load deploy/assets` line from deploy.rb file. Tried redeploying, which worked.

Now, if I again add `load deploy/assets` then it works again as expected.

So, I guess, there is issue with deploy/assets recipes which causes it to fail for first deploy after deploy:setup.

Bullet incorrectly reports N+1 when association in memory\,"I ran into an issue as described here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4792001/eager-loading-in-both-directions

The best solution I could come up with that results in the least amount SQL is to manually assign the object in the belongs_to

eg-

```
product = Product.includes(:variants).first
product.variants.each{ |v| v.product = product }
```

Then, v.product will not cause a SQL call as it's already assigned in memory.  However, Bullet is still reporting this as a missing N+1.  The only way to get Bullet to not report the violation is to do

```
product = Product.includes(:variants => :product).first
```

But this results in an unnecessary SQL statement.

Is there anyway to have Bullet recognize that an association is already loaded in memory and will not cause an N+1?  Alternately, is there a way to tell Bullet to ignore a particular violation reported?

Thanks a lot for the gem and you work maintaining it.

allow 'sys' to be an alias for 'util',"In the migration of Joyent's extensive node-based software stack to 0.8, we have found one of the most tedious (and enraging) issues to be the removal of 'sys' for 'util'.  Yes, we know that this has been deprecated for quite some time -- but it doesn't change the fact that 'sys' has worked and that making this change was excruciatingly painful. (No, we didn't decide to assign 'sys' to the results of ""require('util')"" -- and if that were the recommendation, wouldn't that undermine the putative rationale for the removal of 'sys'?)  To quantify the effect:  we had to make thousands of changes across tens of repos -- changes that were exasperating, to say the least (with great opportunity for a slip-up that wouldn't manifest itself until, say, a critical error message resulted in an uncaught exception).  History has taught us that the issues that we at Joyent experience are likely to be experienced by the broader node base; for this reason, we believe that 'sys' should be permitted as an alias for 'util' for the indefinite future.

Replace FFmpeg with AVConv,"FFmpeg audio/video conversion tool is now known as [AVConv](http://www.libav.org/avconv.html) (a better name in my oppinion). So ""ffmpeg"" command line tool is obsolete and ""avconv"" should be used. As far as I noticed all parameters remained the same, but further investigations should be made. Some modifications need to be done in CIS.

Tasks:
- Install AVConv on the machine(s) that run CIS. Usually avconv should appear be updating ffmpeg (that worked on Ubuntu; not tested for Debian).
- Replace ""ffmpeg"" with ""avconv"" in [cis/api/ffmpeg.py](https://github.com/calinburloiu/P2P-Tube/blob/master/cis/api/ffmpeg.py), class `FFmpegTranscoder`, field `prog_bin`, which represents the conversion tool executable.

"(v. 1.5.3) inline auto_html  working, but auto_html_for does nothing in rails 3.2.5","I saw post on StackExchange similar to this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9928200/rails-auto-html-gem-is-not-working 
for v 1.5.1, but it sounded like the newer version 1.5.2 resolved this. However, I loaded v 1.5.2 and it also did nothing.

Is it possible it wasn't resolved, or that there was a regression? Or am I perhaps doing something wrong?

``` ruby
#post.rb

  auto_html_for :body do
    html_escape
    image
    #youtube(:width => 400, :height => 250)
    #link :target => ""_blank"", :rel => ""nofollow""
    simple_format
  end
```

vs:

``` erb
<%= auto_html(post.body) { html_escape; image; youtube(:width => 500, :height => 280); link :target => ""_blank"", :rel => ""nofollow""; simple_format } %>
```

Which works fine.

Is there some type of gotcha here? I would think this would have been logged here as a bug already.

"assets:precompile succeeds, but doesn't update manifest.yml on compile errors","If you have a file in your assets/javascripts directory with a dot - say ""bootstrap.min.js"", assets:precompile will still do its thing: compressing, minifying, applying MD5 hashes etc - but manifest.yml will only have two entries for the **uncompressed** application.js and application.css - and nothing else.

This also happens if there are stray files in any of the assets directories that assets:precompile doesn't like - (i had an accidental yml file in my assets/images).

Ideally the behavior here would be to a) throw, b) warn, or c) fail completely on assets:precompile. Instead what's happening is the manifest file is ignoring everything except application.js and application.css - and in production you get a runtime error (xxx asset is not compiled) unless ""config.assets.compile = true"" - which of course isn't optimal.

Issues with images," - Original ID: 1135
 - Added by **Eli Sarnat**
 - Scratchpads URL: http://antkey.org/

### Description:
I'm encountering some issues when using the 'insert media' feature of the CKEditor.

1. It seems like the properties (alignment, height, width, border, padding, etc.) I set are not being displayed properly after the page is saved. 

2. On the 'Embedding image' window (screenshot attached)when the cursor hovers over the submit and cancel buttons, the cursor switches from pointer arrow to text cursor (|).

3. (Support Request) Is there a format option that allows me to insert a reduced-sized image that automatically links to an original-sized image? 

Example page: http://antkey.org/content/lucid-key-0
Thanks!

However, if you filter the results by writing something in the search box, the pagination works funny:
it does a doble request every time you reach the bottom, so you load two pages instead of one.

Support for # in Scheme number literals,"From R<sup>5</sup>RS [section 6.2.4](http://www.schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/HTML/r5rs-Z-H-9.html#%_sec_6.2.4):

> A numerical constant may be specified to be either exact or inexact by a prefix. The prefixes are `#e' for exact, and`#i' for inexact. An exactness prefix may appear before or after any radix prefix that is used. If the written representation of a number has no exactness prefix, the constant may be either inexact or exact. It is inexact if it contains a decimal point, an exponent, or a ""#"" character in the place of a digit, otherwise it is exact.

So for example `1###` is a perfectly valid Scheme number and prints a value of `1000.0`. For more information see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10935110/meaning-of-in-scheme-number-literals

The standard SearchableText gets ignored,"When a dexterity content type has the IDublinCore behavior, the title and description fields are searchable. When you enable the dexteritytextindexer behavior, only fields marked as searchable by the new behavior are indexed in the SearchableText index. Perhaps this is meant as a feature, but I think most would consider it a bug. See for example this [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7470152/title-and-description-arent-indexed-with-collective-dexteritytextindexer) question.

What I would propose, is to change the dynamic_searchable_text_indexer function so it returns the standard SearchableText as well as the text from marked fields. That could be done by changing `indexed = []` to `indexed = [obj.Searchabletext()]` in that function

BTW, the new utils.searchable function that is on master, certainly helps too. With that you can handle it manually by putting some code in the `__init__.py` file of a custom package that contains your own content types:

``` python
from collective.dexteritytextindexer.utils import searchable
from plone.app.dexterity.behaviors.metadata import IDublinCore
searchable(IDublinCore, u'title')
searchable(IDublinCore, u'description')
searchable(IDublinCore, u'subjects')  # this field is not searchable by default

template breaks in IE when converted to dreamweaver template,"When I built a site based on this template and tested it in IE9 and IE8 they both triggered quirks mode and made the site look a mess.

I checked my `X-UA-Compatible` which was set to `<meta http-equiv=""X-UA-Compatible"" content=""IE=edge,chrome=1"">` but this didn't resolve it.

It turns out that the conditional comments on the `<html>` tag confuses the dreamweaver template system into putting its template mapping comments above the doctype which threw it into quirks mode.

It was a tricky one to debug as well because that tag isn't shown in the view source of the template.

Here is the offending code:

```
<!--[if lt IE 7]> <html class=""no-js lt-ie9 lt-ie8 lt-ie7"" lang=""en""> <![endif]-->
<!--[if IE 7]>    <html class=""no-js lt-ie9 lt-ie8"" lang=""en""> <![endif]-->
<!--[if IE 8]>    <html class=""no-js lt-ie9"" lang=""en""> <![endif]-->
<!--[if gt IE 8]><!--> <html class=""no-js"" lang=""en""> <!--<![endif]-->
```

Here is the thread that made me realise what had happened:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6294301/dreamweaver-causing-quirks-mode-in-internet-explorer

I don't know if this is something that could be hung off the body tag instead? If not this information should at least be added to the documentation wiki.

sand boxing plugins,"With the current implementation every plugin uses its own directory. Still if two plugins use the same assembly in different versions this will fail. The problem is at the very core of the CLR. Ideally we could unload assemblies so that everytime we use a command we just load those assemblies needed and immediately unload them afterwards. However, unloading assemblies is impossible with the current CLR. The only way to overcome this would be to load assemblies into another application domain and unload the whole application domain afterwards. However, this has it's own drawbacks because you need to use remoting than to communicate with the plugins.

If we want to go down this route we should check out: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4145713/looking-for-a-practical-approach-to-sandboxing-net-plugins

However we might come up with a pseudo sand boxing approach where each plugin by convention sits in a directory named as the command name and then we delay the plugin loading until the very moment where the command is being used. 

This will at least work for fire and forget usages (Read: one off usage, using the oss scheduler for example). If we would use it in non-interactive mode we would still clash into a version conflict, once we mix commands that share the same assembly in different versions. Another con would be the strict convention about the directory name of the plugin. However, we could overcome this using Mono.Cecil and a new command name approach:

Mono.Cecil is capable to read into an assembly without actually loading it (in contrast to System.Reflection). We could then say that we drop the `Name` property which is now responsible to make up the command name and instead use a convention where the command class name is used. E.g.

```
public class FooCommand
{
}
```

would automatically become the ""foo"" command (omitting the ""Command"" itself)

If we want to go that route we might want to look into this:

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4371539/lazy-loading-dlls-with-mef?rq=1

Another option might be to preprocess all plugins (e.g. with Mono.Cecil) to produce new ""runtime plugins"" which are rewritten to not clash with the assemblies. However, this could be a rocky road as well.

If we want to go that route we might want to check out this:

```
def configure_header(config, &block)
  header = Versionist::VersioningStrategy::Header.new(config)
  route_hash = {:module => config[:module], :constraints => header}
  route_hash.merge!({:defaults => config[:defaults]}) if config.has_key?(:defaults)

Add AllowParallel option to the ICommand Interface,"shell.me aims to be a perfect fit to be 

a.) a very simple library to build your own shell from
b.) a simple host for a scheduled command (scheduled via OS facilities)

For the latter options you might want to kick of tasks that are pretty unpredictable in time consumption. However, you still want to run them frequently but you don't want to overlap them either. Your OS scheduler facility might have an option to prevent multiple identical tasks from running in parallel. However, that's fine if you only use shell.me to host one task. But if you host severel independent task you actually do want to allow multiple instances of shell.me to run, what you don't want to happen is that multiple instances of shell.me run the exact same command at the same time.

So here is the proposal:

```
1. Add a boolean AllowParallel Property to the ICommand interface (should be true by default)

2. In case it is false:

   Before shell.me kicks of the command it should check:

A. if there is already a file .lock_commandname_* (if so, abort)

B. if not, create .lock_commandname_GUID

C. check if .lock_foo_GUID exists and if no other .lock_foo_* file exists
```

if there is another `.lock_foo_*` file, that means that another instance created one at the simultanously and we abort and remove our lock file

Can clipping paths be used with d3.svg.symbol ?,"I'm trying to draw multiple 'cross' symbols inside of a circle for use in a visualization. I'd like to draw the crosses in a 'g' tag and then apply a clipping path.

Is it possible to use clip paths with d3.svg.symbol ?

In the below example, the svg circle is masked correctly with the clip path; however the cross (the last part of the code) isn't.

Am I doing something wrong or is this not a feature?

```
var svg = d3.select(""#maskingExample"")
    .append(""svg:svg"")
    .attr(""width"", 500)
    .attr(""height"", 200);

guarantee child view `onShow` methods are called,"originally posted as part of a stackoverflow question ( http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10887040/how-do-i-render-dom-dependent-views-in-a-collectionview/10889558#comment14196511_10889558 )

it might be nice to have this baked in to marionette, so that at least the first level of children in a collection view / composite view will have their `onShow` method called.

``` js
ItemView = Marionette.ItemView.extend({
  // ...

  onShow: function(){
    // I am guaranteed to be called from the CollectionView
    // because the CollectionView registers me in a promise
  }
});

CollectionView = Marionette.CollectionView.extend({

  initialize: function(){
    this.onShowCallbacks = new Marionette.Callbacks();
  },

  onShow: function(){
    this.onShowCallbacks.run();
  },

  appendHtml: function(cv, iv){
    cv.append(iv.el);

    // promise to run 'onShow' if it exists
    if (iv.hasOwnProperty(""onShow"")){
      this.onShowCallbacks.add(iv.onShow);
    }
  }
});
```

it would need to be extracted in to something more generic so that we don't hijack `onShow`, but that should be easy enough.

Less wide in IE(8) than in Chrome or Firefox?,"Hi again 

Sorry to raise another question so soon after my last one (thank you for your help, Konstantin with that one) I have been viewing the test site I am working on Chrome, Firefox and IE(8) and have been really happy with how the site is working in the first two browsers (inevitably :p) and having to tweak small things just for IE.  

However, one thing I have noticed is that - out of the box - the full width of The Bootstrap seems to be more narrow in IE than in Chrome or Firefox.

Put another way - the spaces to the left and right of the main content appear wider in IE, so the sidebar and content become more 'squished'.

Apologies for this really strange question, but any advice would be much appreciated about how best to change the display on IE.

Many thanks

Kind Regards

I do know that as soon as I comment out the pusher class initialization it no longer errors out. 

I looked at Firefox [changelog](https://www.mozilla.org/security/known-vulnerabilities/firefox.html) and noticed that on version 12 there are several XSS and security patches introduced which seems to be the cause of this issue. 

Also not sure if relevant but the error is not present when running the rails app locally, only on the server.  We are using pusher version  0.8.5 and Rails 3.0.14

Please let me know if I can be of any assistance troubleshooting this issue.

Help in consuming services,"I have posted my issue at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11147077/how-do-i-figure-out-what-a-wcf-service-is-expecting

it is as fallows, I am hoping you as the developer can give me more insight..

I am using Node.js and wcf.js module (npm install wcf.js) The service i am trying to consume is https://webservice.kareo.com/services/soap/2.1/

I have figure out that this https://webservice.kareo.com/services/soap/2.1/KareoServices.svc?xsd=xsd0 contains what the service is looking to receive and that these https://webservice.kareo.com/services/soap/2.1/KareoServices.svc?wsdl=wsdl0 are the uri's to submit them to.

How in the world do i figure out how I am supposed to structure the request? This is the example given to my by wcf.js

var BasicHttpBinding = require('wcf.js').BasicHttpBinding
  , Proxy = require('wcf.js').Proxy
  , binding = new BasicHttpBinding()
  , proxy = new Proxy(binding, "" https://webservice.kareo.com/services/soap/2.1/"")

Console output:

```
undefined

There is no `return` statement for the setter, so it returns `undefined`. This gets cached and is returned when `object.get(""prop"")` is called. What should be returned though is `""value""`.

Obviously this would work, if you always did `return prop;` at the end. But it is easy to forget.  And shouldn't you rather `return this;` for the setter? Because that is what  `set()` returns for regular properties.

-XstartOnFirstThread causes problems on Linux,"Hi there,

I was trying out the SWT plugin, and it seems it cannot be run on Linux (tested with Ubuntu 12.04, 64bit) as it is. Seems the problem lies with the file _Events.groovy. On line 24 it reads: ""buildConfig.griffon.app.javaOpts << '-XstartOnFirstThread'"". It appears Linux can make no sense out of this option at all (tested with both Oracle's JDK and the OpenJDK); in fact trying to start any application now completely fails to load the VM. Removing the line seems to work nicely. I don't know, however, how this affects other operating systems.

Regards,
Fryie

クライアントで実装するのと、Django組み込みのテストクライアントで処理するのとでは
違いがあって、僕の勘違いな点もあるかと思うのですが、意見として

１．認証に際して、ユーザーのパスワードはアクセストークンを引数として渡すが
名前をどう渡すかがはっきりしていない？

２．クライアント側は、最初の認証でサーバー側にユーザー作成の依頼（authの呼び出し）をして、
その後ログインして発行されるcookie,sessionを保存すればいい？
OR サーバーはauthで作成とloginの両方を行う。（どちらにせよ内部では２つの処理が行われています。）

Registering FormServiceProvider before Twig in the docs,"I'm wondering if the docs for FormServiceProvider should state that `FormServiceProvider()` must be registered before `TwigServiceProvider()` is registered, otherwise it returns exceptions  such as `Twig_Error_Syntax: The function ""form_widget"" does not exist`. I'm not sure if `TranslationServiceProvider()` also needs be registered before Twig, I haven't tested it yet, but it's the order that works for me.

http://silex.sensiolabs.org/doc/providers/form.html

Example

```
<?php 
use Silex\Provider\FormServiceProvider;
// ....etc

$app->register(new FormServiceProvider());

$app->register(new Silex\Provider\TranslationServiceProvider(), array(
    'locale_fallback' => 'en',
));

$app->register(new Silex\Provider\TwigServiceProvider(), array(

VisualPHPUnit 2.0 strong security issue...,"On \app\controller\Filelist :

The system should look only into unit test case folder and child of test folder.

```
//Check the the base dir is valid
$dir = realpath($dir);

//Only allow valid filename characters
$folder = preg_replace('/[^a-z0-9\.\-_]/i', '', $folder);

//If this is a bad path or a bad end folder name
if( $dir === false || !$folder || $folder === '.') {
    return false;

}

I put this outside FileList but of course it should be included inside...

In FileList class (app => controller => FileList, index function) :
        if ( !$request->is('ajax') ) {
            return $this->redirect('/');
        }

```
    $dir = null;
    global $config;
    if($request->query['dir'] === """"){
        $dir = $config[""test_directory""];
    }else{
        $dir = realpath(urldecode($request->query['dir']));
        $dir .= DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR;
    }

    if ( !$dir || !is_sub_dir($dir, $config[""test_directory""]) ) {
        return array();
    }
```

I also add the fact that if folder is empty, the system catch the test directory from bootstrap (that's why there is a global scope used here).
This correct this small problem.

Issue with loading html5 video in Chrome.,"I have found a very puzzling problem, and a kinda pointless workaround which solves it. I'd like to post both here so that someone might be able to figure out what is going on. 

With this code, the video seems to load, but won't play:

``` javascript

var vidHTML = '<div id=""curVidModal""><video id=""curVidModal-'+slug+'"" class=""video-js MMvideo""  \
            controls preload=""auto"" width=""'+vidW+'"" height=""'+vidH+'""\
            '+ webM + '\
            <source src=""'+vidUrl+'.mp4"" type=""video/mp4"" />\
        </video></div>';

        jQuery('body').append(vidHTML);

        //launch in fancybox
        jQuery.fancybox( jQuery(""#curVidModal""), {
            'type': 'inline',
            'tpl': {
                wrap: '<div class=""fancybox-wrap"">\
                        <div class=""fancybox-skin"">\
                            <div class=""fancybox-outer"">\
                                <div class=""fancybox-inner fancybox-whiteInner""></div>\
                            </div>\
                        </div>\
                    </div>',
            }, etc....

```

Here is the solution, but I'm still not sure what the original problem was, or why this works. Would rather not use this awkward method if possible:

``` javascript

var vidHTML = '<div id=""curVidModal""><video id=""curVidModal-'+slug+'"" class=""video-js MMvideo""  \
            controls preload=""auto"" width=""'+vidW+'"" height=""'+vidH+'""\
            '+ webM + '\
            <source src=""'+vidUrl+'.mp4"" type=""video/mp4"" />\
        </video></div>';

        //Need to use a strange hack on fancybox where the video wont load in chrome unless it is included in the tpl wrap
        //we launch the fancybox using a dummy div set to the correct width
        jQuery('body').append('<div id=""curVidModalShim""></div>');
        jQuery('#curVidModalShim').css({'width':vidW+'px'});

        //launch in fancybox
        jQuery.fancybox( jQuery(""#curVidModalShim""), {
            'type': 'inline',
            'tpl': {
                wrap: '<div class=""fancybox-wrap"">\
                        <div class=""fancybox-skin"">\
                            <div class=""fancybox-outer"">\
                                <div class=""fancybox-inner fancybox-whiteInner"">'+vidHTML+'</div>\
                            </div>\
                        </div>\

sslproto module fails to detect clients connecting with export-grade ciphers,"To reproduce the problem checkout fix-sslproto-export-ciphers branch. This branch has sslv2 disabled. Run bin/test-sslcaudit:

        ECCAR(sslproto(tlsv1, EXPORT), <sslcaudit.modules.sslproto.ServerHandler.Connected object at 0x29bb4d0>)
FAIL

It can be shown that openssl itself behaves correctly. Do the following from sslcaudit/ directory, to make sure paths to certs and key are correct. 

Running openssl server with export cipher
# openssl s_server -cert test/certs/www.example.com-cert.pem -key test/certs/www.example.com-key.pem -cipher EXPORT

Asking openssl client connect to it.
# openssl s_client -connect localhost:4433 -cipher EXPORT
...
    Cipher    : EXP-EDH-RSA-DES-CBC-SHA
It works as expected, an export-grade cipher is chosen

Now, replace the server with sslcaudit (run the client the same way, in a loop):

Running validation on model's attributes in a has_one polymorphic relationship,"The model Matchup is part of a polymorphic has_one relationship.

``` ruby
class Matchup < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :matchupable, :polymorphic => true

  validates :matchupable_id, :matchupable_type, :presence => true,
    :if => Proc.new { |record| record.is_baseball? }
end

class BaseballMatchup < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_one :matchup, :as => :matchupable
end
```

When I run the following spec, the validates presence of returns false for the first spec. In version 2.3.2, the spec ran successfully.  After updating to 3.3.0, it fails.

``` ruby
describe Matchup do

  specify { Matchup.build(matchupable_id: nil, matchupable_type: nil) .should be_valid } # fails
  specify { Matchup.build(matchupable_id: 1, matchupable_type: 'BaseballMatchup') .should be_valid } # passes

end
```

Doesn't seem like the Proc is being evaluated when the validation method is called. Any help would be appreciated.

nth-child selector failing for elements directly under body,"https://gist.github.com/2871708

In the above gist, I have a working HTML file that shows the failure scenarios.

Summary: the paragraphs report the proper length: d3.selectAll(""p"")
as do the divs:  d3.selectAll(""div"")

However, the nth-child selector has a weird shift with the divs:
d3.selectAll(""div:nth-child(1)"")  <-- this is empty
d3.selectAll(""div:nth-child(3)"")  <-- this is not empty and it _should_ be empty

The paragraphs are fine, _unless_ you move them to the top of the doc, (not surrounded by the #container div).

I haven't narrowed down what other scenarios could make it fail.

How to use with Bootstrap-Sass gem,"I have setup using plain ERB tempting the following in a view that contains an individuals date of birth (dob).

I'm new at this Rails/HTML5/CSS3/jQuery/bootstrap gig as you can probably tell from this 'how to use' question.

Your example has how the input should look. Can you confirm if the data-behaviour='date picker' should go in my bootstrap div class statement or in my f.text_field (for the input). I have tried both but don't seem to be getting this to fire.

```
<div class=""field span2 data-behaviour='datepicker'"">
  <%= f.text_field :dob %>
  <%= f.label :dob, ""Birth Date"" %>
</div>
```

or

```
<div class=""field span2"">
  <%= f.text_field :dob, :class => ""data-behaviour='datepicker'"" %>
  <%= f.label :dob, ""Birth Date"" %>
</div>
```

Does the 'autoclose' fire as soon as one clicks the date entry. Other date pickers I have played with (jQuery) automatically update the field on selection. Do we have to pick this up with the change event?

I don't actually care how to design ticgit but I personally like the Gitolite -way of doing things.

AJAX Binding Lost on DOM replacement,"Hi,

I'm not sure if this is a bug or just me not knowing how to do things in Rails.  But I have an issue very similar this one:
https://github.com/rails/jquery-ujs/issues/242

Except that the correct DOM element is getting replaced.  I wasn't sure if I should post on that issue and reopen it or post a new one.  I apologize in advance if I'm using the issues forum wrongly.

Here's my problem:
When I use the form_for tag with :remote set to true, I can submit the form to the server and everything works. However, when the response comes back and I've replaced my DOM elements, any subsequent clicks on the submit button won't work. The button just takes me to the regular edit form instead of doing an AJAX submission.

I think the javascript/jQuery binding to the button element is lost when the DOM elements are replaced.

Is there a way to reattach the bindings or is it suppose to be automatically whenever an AJAX response is received? Or should we not replace the submit button?

I haven't tried to work around this by manually replacing each form element with the new data from the AJAX response. Right now I'm just replacing the entire partial rendering; the submit button is also inside the partial. I've search as much as I could so I thought maybe the experts have an idea.

I've looked through:
https://github.com/JangoSteve/Rails-jQuery-Demo/tree/master/app/views/comments
but it seems like it's only doing a create and destroy.  In my scenario, I'm doing a modify.  And after an object is modified, the user is still on the same page, so s/he can modify that object again.  With the create and destroy, you no longer need the same submit button.  I could be reading the code in the repository wrong though.

Here's a GIST of the basic code:
https://gist.github.com/3006966

Thank you for your time!

SHKFlushOfflineQueue Crash,"Hey,

Apparently, there is an EXC_BAD_ACCESS crash whenever I call [SHK FlushOfflineQueue];

I am not sure why this is happening but I had to resubmit my update for an update without this because it is causing the app to crash on startup.

I am not sure if it has to do with the skip attribute backup code or not but this is quite unfortunate. I have also added CoreFoundation and added it as Optional too.

Any ideas why this is happening?

Thanks!

Updated package running,"Hi All,Chee Seng,

I found a [minor issue here](https://github.com/cheeseng/scala-ide/blob/master/org.scala-ide.sdt.scalatest/src/scala/tools/eclipse/scalatest/launching/ScalaTestLaunchDelegate.scala#L217). The basic problem is that package tests wont run for e.g. imported external projects, because the test package is located with a relative URL to the workspace.

Another issue is that `JavaRuntime.getProjectOutputDirectory(configuration)` might return `null` in some specific projects, e.g., when it was mateiralized from a Maven POM, or created by `sbt eclipse`.

The problem is that the project won't have a default output directory. For instance, a project may have different source folders (even for tests, like unit and integration tests in different Eclipse source folders) and output folders. For example, sbt puts the classes under `target/scala-2.9.1/classes` and the test classes under `target/scala-2.9.1/test-classes`.

The result is that when the user right-clicks on a package, it cannot be run with the `Run As -> ScalaTest - Package` action.

It took me quite a while to find and make an initial fix for the issue, probably you can make it better, but thought you might find my fix useful.

Also, I'm a bit unsure if I've done the addition of PowerMock properly to the project, and as I've noted in the code, it would be great if someone could verify the `escapeScalaTestClasspathComponent()` function I wrote.

Thanks in advance for any feedback!

Android: MvxBindableListItemView instances leaking,"Hello,

consider the following layout:

            android:layout_height=""fill_parent""

            local:MvxItemTemplate=""@layout/itemlayout""
            local:MvxBind=""{'ItemsSource':{'Path':'Items'}}"" />

where ""Items"" will be an object implementing INotifyCollectionChanged and ""itemlayout"" is

-FrameLayout xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android""
    xmlns:local=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/MyApp""

-/FrameLayout-

then I found the created instances of MvxBindableListItemView (and the contained FrameLayout and TextView) to be leaking. Moreover, MvxJavaContainer instances leak in roughly the same number.

There is no leaking when the itemlayout is not bound.

What I found out using the Dalvik Debug Monitor and the Eclipse Memory Analyzer ist that all MvxBindableListItemView, FrameLayout and TextView instances are marked as residing on the native stack, they mainly hold circular references to another (with some ColorDrawable instances in between). I couldn't really find any Java-Class holding to all that instances so I assume the references are kept alive by the binding on the .net-side (with MvxJavaContainer possibly bridging the two sides).

coding the analog in task in a more flexible way,"Now analog in channels can be declared and configured using the
ServerSettings object editor.

The analog in task can also be triggered by an external source, allowing
for good synchronization even when a variable timebase is used.

PS : for some reason, to have atticus compiled on my computer, I had to
move the ""Opal Kelly"" directory into the ""AtticusServer"" one. I do not
commit this change, but this is weird.

PPS: this is my first time using github, so if I did something wrong please let me know :)

"Connection error on all platforms, online and offline","Happens on both Windows/MySQL(see **Windows**) and Ubuntu/postgreSQL (see **Ubuntu**).
## The Cause

Sources allege that this is a “known issue” that just happens and should be ignored as such. You can disregard the log errors in the terminal, but it becomes a problem, when it stops your deployment to such PaaS as dotCloud (see [dotCloud](#dotCloud)). This also seems to go against the belief that this is a [_browser_ quirk](http://stackoverflow.com/a/7913160/419005).

Someone suggests:

> It doesn't seem like a DB error, seems like the naive implementation of the development http server having timing issue. If your requests take long enough it'll throw that error.
## The Fix

It is hard to imagine that this is something that merely needs monkey-patching. However, in the case of PaaS, tweaking the nginx config has been suggested as so:

```
proxy_intercept_errors off;
```

If this is an error caused by timeouts, an attempt should be made to deploy the instance from another internet connection.

let the names of the requested features be customizable,"The names of the features which required by the components are currently hard coded, like so:

``` python
class SpikeDetector(base.Component):

which imposes some limitations on how those components may be interconnected. For example, if one wants to use different filter for spike extraction, it will not be possible without inheriting the current SpikeExtractor and modifying the code.

One possible way to overcome this limitation without change in the API:

``` python
class SpikeDetector(base.Component):
    """"""Detect Spikes with alignment""""""
    def __init__(self, ... , waveform_src = ""SignalSource""):

Project 2D coordinates to 3D - How to get the width/height of a particle?,"Firstly, I'm very sorry to write this here. I have asked this question in Stackoverflow but no one has answered. I think for myself and many other 2D game programmers out there, it is very important to know the width or height of a particle as it is needed for basic collision detection. 

I am creating a particle as follows:

```
texture = new THREE.Texture(assetManager.getAsset(image))
texture.needsUpdate = true
material = new THREE.ParticleBasicMaterial { map: texture, blending: THREE.AdditiveBlending }
mesh = new THREE.Particle( material )
```

This works perfectly and as expected. My problem is how can I get its width? Not in pixels but in display units?

If I know the width of the particle then I can do simple collision detection, for example:

   if particle.x + 0.5 \* particle. width > boundary  For example. 

I know I must be missing something simple. I have looked at the code for particle and 3DObject but can see no way of return its size. 

Please, please, please could somebody help me. (on my hand on knees)

"node 0.8, npm 1.1.32 compatibility ","In trying to update node-expat on OSX after updating node to 0.8 + npm 1.1.32,  but I run into several issues. The node-expat installer can't find my node path, and it can't find the expat.h. I have the expat.h header in several locations /usr/local/include and /opt/local/include. Before updating node the node-expat install was ok. What else can I try to solve this? I've tried several versions of node-expat up to 0.6

problems with eclipse,"Hi, 

newbie question here: I loaded the project in eclipse, connected my samsung phone and hit the run button: I get three error messages: 

1) the project was not built since its build path is incomplete. Cannot find the class file for java.lang.Object
2)The type java.lang.Object cannot be resolved. It is indirectly referenced from required .class files
3) Unable to resolve target 'android-8'

...any advice will be really appreciated.

Thanks

Syncing tickets with different Content-hosts such as Savannah/Github/Bitbucket/local-repo/etc,"Now we have a situation:
1. Ticgit has its own Issues under Ticgit -branch
2. Github has its own proprietary Issues, apparently impossible to export similarly to Bitbucket

----> 1&2 sucks. No sync. No co-operation?

**Common problem 1:** tickets between proprietary content-hosts such as Bitbucket.org and Github.org are not synced to TicGit.

**Common problem 2:** TicGitWeb sucks because we don't use it? I even ask whether devs are actually using TicGit?
1. Is it possible to co-operate with Bicbucket.org or Github.com so there is less reinvention of wheels? It is does not look good when Ticgit's own Ticgits are 1-3 years' old at least! 
2. Consult developers in Savannah [2] whether they could add some sort of support for TicGit -issues. They are apparently using some Trac -thing and some free-software so it should be easier to co-operate.

TODO 1: contact Bitbucket.org for API -question, can they read Ticgit -style formatted tickets?
TODO 2: contact Github.com for API -question, can they read Ticgit -style formatted tickets?
TODO 3: if they do not  co-operate, we need find alternative way to the proprietary things.  
TODO 4: is it possible manage TicGit's things through Gitolite so third-parties do not need to care about parsing TicGit's branches? Yes apparently versions/milestones but too much overhead with other things?!

Autoload fail #3,"hehe ;)

thx for the fix: https://github.com/phpseclib/phpseclib/issues/12

but this is not right too ;)
1. plz change the order, first check ""class_exits"" and than ""function_exists"" -> class will always not exists, so the autoloader will call, after the autoloader has load the file, the class dosn't exists anymore, so will check with ""function_exists"" and it will return ""true"" and all will fine, so change it to:

``` PHP
/**
* Include Crypt_Random
*/
// the class_exists() will only be called if the crypt_random function hasn't been defined and
// will trigger a call to __autoload() if you're wanting to auto-load classes
if (!class_exists('Crypt_Random') && !function_exists('crypt_random')) {
    require_once('Crypt/Random.php');
}
```
1. you ask about, how to use my autoloader ? i know, it is a ""abstract"" class, so you can't initalisise a instance of it and you dont need it and you dont need to extend it, just call it static ;) in my case (Symfony 2):

``` PHP
PHPSecLibAutoloader::registerAutoload($appRoot.'/../vendor/phpseclib/phpseclib/');
```

so always think about ""KIS"" -> keep it simple ;):P
