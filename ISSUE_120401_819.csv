MultipleOutputs support?,"MultipleOutputs would be hugely beneficial in conjunction with emr-s3-io.  Unfortunately they appear to be incompatible on the current EMR hadoop version.

Perhaps this is hard to solve... But EMR runs on 0.20.205.  This project uses the ""new"" mapreduce API rather than the mapred API.  Unfortunately, MultipleOutputs in 0.20.205 only works on the ""old"" mapred API:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9876456/hadoop-multipleoutputs-addnamedoutput-throws-cannot-find-symbol

(Later solved in MAPREDUCE-370)

This creates a incompatibility between emr-s3-io and MultipleOutputs.  

Backport emr-s3-io to the old mapred API?  Or possibly do you have a fix for MultipleOutputs that would be compatible?

Eco template renders integer when using 'end' statement,"I have a pretty simple Backbone View that I'd like to have render some blocks of HTML conditionally. I'm seeing a behavior where following the conditionally rendered HTML there is a integer rendered as well. From what I can tell, it seems to happen when I use the `end` statement to terminate a conditional block. 

Here's some code that is demonstrating the error for me:

```
<% if true: %>Hello World!<% end %>

I would expect this to render`Hello World!` into the containing element. However, it's actually rendering `Hello World!2`.

```
<% if true: %>Foo, <% end %>
<% if true: %>Bar, <% end %>

I would expect this to render `Foo, Bar, Baz` into the containing element. However, it's actually rendering `Foo, 2 Bar, 5 Baz8`. After running a somewhat larger set of them, it seems the integer being printed goes up by 3 every time.

Values with parentheses,"Hi,

in my application, I'm using jquery-tokeninput to select some values containing parantheses.
The highlighting Regexp take these parantheses from the value into account while counting the regexp references.

That is leading to two problems:
1. The matching element is not highlighted, if the value contains parantheses.
2. If the value contains only a ""("" and no "")"", the regexp will fail and no selection list is shown at all.

I solved it with the following `onResult` callback, but I think, it should be the default:

``` javascript
    onResult: function (results) {
      jQuery.each(results, function (index, value) {
        value.name = value.name.replace(/\(/g, '&#40;').replace(/\)/g, '&#41;');

Problem getting eigenvector resolution of matrix,"Following this suggestion ( http://stackoverflow.com/a/6879889 ) I've tried to use sympy to (numerically) get the eigenvalues of a matrix. Here's some code that reproduces (some of) my problems. It's not exactly what I did but it conforms to the suggestion at stackoverflow.com (I don't understand why 'data' is originally defined using the SingletonRegistry class but that's another story; copying that didn't seem to help):

(You can hear the crickets chirping...)

I know that's a wrong result because I can evaluate the same matrix (attached) with Octave and the results make sense:

```
> m=load('matrix.dat');
> [evecs,evals]=eig(m'); %
> diag(evals)
ans =
  -2.5206e+06
  -1.0511e+06
  -1.0000e+06
  -6.9588e-08
  -6.3287e-03
```

Unfortunately, for some of the matrices I'm working with I exceed the numerical precision of Octave and get complex eigenvalues and junk. So I need either 128-bit floats or an arbitrary precision library, which is what brought me to sympy.

tooltip and popover not working on TABLE elements,"Hey there,

Like the title says, triggering a tooltip or popover javascript on a link inside a TABLE, TR or TD simply does not work, whereas using the exact same code with a DIV, SPAN, etc. works perfectly fine.

Using this javascript:

```
$(document).ready(function() {
    $('.example').tooltip({ 
        selector: 'A'
    });
});
```

This does not work:
<code>< table class=""example"" >< a href=""#"" title=""this should show up"" >hover me< /a >< /table ></code>

Whereas this works just fine:
<code>< div class=""example"" >< a href=""#"" title=""this should show up"" >hover me< /a >< /div ></code>

Is it just me?

Emoji renders incorrectly,"Hi, I've been trying to replace UILabel with TTTAttributedLabel so I can lankily URLS, I came across a weird edge-case involving emoji, I don't know if its indicative of a ""larger problem"", but might be worth looking at.

background: This is a tableview in which the cells contains a UILabel, in 

```
- (CGFloat)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView heightForRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath
```

I calculate the height of the cell using the following:

```

                CGSize requiredSize = [text sizeWithFont:[UIFont fontWithName:@""American Typewriter"" size:17]
                                       constrainedToSize:CGSizeMake(POST_WIDTH, CGFLOAT_MAX)
                                           lineBreakMode:UILineBreakModeWordWrap];

                return 30 + requiredSize.height + 10;
```

(30 for the header + the required label height + 10 for the footer).

This works fine for UILabel and TTTAttributedLabel as long as they're displaying ""plain text"". As soon as the text contains an emoji the UILabel continues to render correctly, however the TTAttributedLabel no longer renders anything!  (i.e. _the TTTAttributedLabel view is completely ""empty"" as if nothing was rendered into it_).

If I change the +10 to +16 (i.e to _add an extra 6 pixels to the label_) the text then renders properly, except with extra whitespace.

Initial investigation shows that the text is being rendered differently (some screenshots):

**UILabel:**
![uilabel](http://tonymillion.com/uilabel.png)

**TTTAttributedLabel**
![uilabel](http://tonymillion.com/tttattributedlabel.png)

Notice how the Emoji is rendered vertically centred on the UILabel, but baseline on the TTTAttributedLabel?

I don't have a solution just yet - I'll report back any findings but I wanted to log the issue incase you already know how to fix it!

Consistent closure behaviour,"# Scope of Change

Consistent rules will be defined for closure behaviour.
# Rationale

With the number of platforms XP language runs on [opening up](https://github.com/thekid/xp-js), we need to define rules to apply to any platform.
# Functionality
## This

Example:

``` groovy
public class Lambda {
  protected string $greeting= 'Hello';

  protected var greeter() {
    return #{ $who -> $this.greeting ~ ' ' ~ $who };
  }

  public static void main(string[] $args) {
    $greeter= new self().greeter();
    util.cmd.Console::writeLine($greeter.($args[0] ?: 'World'));
  }
}
```

This should print `Hello World` if invoked with any arguments. The `$this` variable should be bound to the scope of where the closure is defined.
## Closing on loop variables

Example

``` groovy
public class Lambda {

  public static void main(string[] $args) {
    $callbacks= [];
    for ($i= 0; $i < 2; $i++) {
      $callbacks[]= #{ -> $i };
    }
    util.cmd.Console::writeLine($callbacks[0].());
  }
}
```

This should print `0`.

Callback function on the client stops working after calling FileResult method in the controller of MVC app,"Hello,

First of all fantastic job. I'm using SignalR 0.4.0 (installed through Nuget) I hope there is a simple explanation for this. I have a web application that uses Asp.Net MVC 3 framework. I setup the hubs on my layout page and everything works fine until I click on a link that looks something like this: 

< a class=""reportLink"" href=""javascript:void(0)"" onclick=""location.href='@Url.Content(""~/Home"")/DownloadFile?fileName=' + escape('@report.ExcelReportViewModel.FileName') + '&fileUrl=' + escape('@report.ExcelReportViewModel.FileUrl') + '&contentType=application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet';"">Link</a >

As you can see all it does essentially is calling the DownloadFile method in the controller which is a FileResult action. After this the callback on my page for receiving the signals doesn't work anymore. I also have a simple form on my page that sends a notification and that one works fine (even after clicking on the link to download the file) and other clients receive the notification; however, like I said the callback method for receiving the signals on the current client never gets called again.

(I have tried this in latest version of Chrome and IE8, and also using IIS 7.5)

Any help is greatly appreciated.

An error occured while installing rake (0.9.2.2), and Bundler cannot continue.`

I found a Stack Overflow discussion ""bundle install fails with SSL certificate verification error""[1] which suggests to create or modify a file called .gemrc in your home path, including the line `:ssl_verify_mode: 0`. That works but the RubyGems 1.8.23 release notes say this is not recommended.

Instead, the RubyGems 1.8.23 release notes recommend:

`configure SSL certificate usage in RubyGems through the
:ssl_ca_cert and :ssl_verify_mode options in ~/.gemrc and /etc/gemrc.
The recommended way is to set :ssl_ca_cert to the CA certificate for
your server or a certificate bundle containing your CA certification`

All I'm doing is connecting to https://rubygems.org/. It's not a ""custom RubyGems server.""

I didn't have this problem before installing RubyGems 1.8.23 and Ruby 1.9.3p194.

Why do I get the failure?

What's the recommended way to fix this?

Route when something is wrong,"Hi Guys,

I have installed the FOSUserBundle and have setted a {% render ""FOSUserBundle:Security:login %} in my layout file, and for that to work i had to first disable the {% extends ""FOSUserBundle::layout.html.twig"" %} form the overridden login.html.twig.

Now however the problem is, when one of the credentials is incorrect, it goes to /login, but that displays ofcourse without the layout file as i had to disable it to be able to render it.

As my login is integrated in my layout i would just want it to return to the default index when one of the credentials is incorrect. How is that done with this bundle ? Must i overwrite the security controller ? And pass it too my index instead of the login.html.twig used by the bundle ?

pandas.Series.__eq__ is broken for series with different index,"Something seems to be wrong with s1 == s2 when s1 and s2 don't have the same index. Here is a snippet example:

``` python
import operator
import pandas
s1 = pandas.Series([1,2], ['a','b'])

s1 == s2
s2 == s1
```

with the output:

```
InIn [5]: s1 == s2
Out[5]: 
a    False
b    False

In [6]: s2 == s1
Out[6]: 
b    False
c    False
```

On the other hand using combine works fine:

```
In [7]: s1.combine(s2, operator.eq)
Out[7]: 
a    0
b    1
c    0

In [8]: s2.combine(s1, operator.eq)
Out[8]: 
a    0
b    1
c    0

I guess you can first align s1 and s2 and then compare them, but is there a good reason why this couldn't work out of the box?

gc linker does not export _end,"by **johnkgallagher**:

<pre>What steps will reproduce the problem?

GNU ld exports the symbol _end to mark the address of the end of the data sections. This
can be used as a way to programmatically get at the start of the heap (see
<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3565232/how-to-programmatically-get-the-address-of-the-heap-on-linux)"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3565232/how-to-programmatically-get-the-address-of-the-heap-on-linux)</a>.
If a shared library wrapped with cgo is expecting _end to exist, the address of _end
appears to be relocated.

An example:

First create libfoo.so:
bash$ cat foo.h
int foo(void);

bash$ cat foo.c
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
char *ppp1 = &quot;hello world&quot;;
char ppp0[] = &quot;hello world&quot;;
extern void *_end; /* any type would do, only its address is important */
int foo() {
  void *p = calloc(10000,1);
  printf( &quot;end:%p heap:%p rodata:%p data:%p\n&quot;, &amp;_end, p, ppp1, ppp0 );
  return 0;
}

bash$ gcc -fPIC -shared foo.c -o libfoo.so

What is the expected output?

Using a gcc-compiled c program, note that end is below the heap.

bash$ cat tmp.c
#include &quot;foo.h&quot;
int main() {
  return foo();
}
bash$ gcc tmp.c -L. -lfoo
bash$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. ./a.out 
end:0x6009d8 heap:0x13ac010 rodata:0x7fe97df7c758 data:0x7fe97e17ca00

What do you see instead?

Using cgo, end is relocated with libfoo:

bash$ cat tmp.go
package main
/*
#cgo LDFLAGS: -L. -lfoo
#include &quot;foo.h&quot;
*/
import &quot;C&quot;
func main() {
    C.foo()

Linux/amd64

go1

Please provide any additional information below.

My first inclination is &quot;libraries shouldn't do this - it sure looks like a nasty
hack&quot;. However, I've seen at least one library (that I'm not in a position to
modify) that expects this to work, and I currently can't wrap it with cgo. I wonder if
6l should be exporting all of the pseudo-magic symbols that GNU ld does, at least on
Linux. It looks like GNU ld exports at least _end, end, _edata, and __bss_start, all of
which are included as &quot;ABSOLUTE&quot; symbols in .dynsym and .symtab; the binaries
compiled with go build don't export any absolute symbols.</pre>

Hi.

This is basically from:
http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg\_id=29104399
https://lists.mindrot.org/pipermail/openssh-unix-dev/2012-April/030379.html

But as no one knew a solution, and the problem seems to clearly exist, I've add this as a bug to track it down :)

What I do is using Icinga (it happens with Nagios, too, btw) and having checks on remote hosts executed via ssh.
In order to dramatically speed checks up (from about 0,300 ms to 0,010 ms) I use ControlMaster = auto, which also makes the mux process spawned on the first check.
As checks are typically sequentially scheduled I want the mux process to persist but it should also go away automatically after some days if not re-used (e.g. when I don't check a host anymore).
So I have something like ControlPersist 2d.

Now I stumbled across the following problem (and I'm actually not sure
whether it's a ssh issue or Icinga):
The first time the check is done (which is when the mux process is
spawned) it times out.
The mux process keeps running and everything works on subsequent
checks.

The timeout is one enforced by Icinga (60s), when it thinks the command doesn't return.

I made some checks and the following turns out to happen on the FIRST connection:
- executing the command on the remote side is actually done
- on the local side, the ssh process (or a wrapper shell script around) becomes a zombie as soon as the remote command was executed
- after 60s, when Icinga enforces it's timeout, the zombie goes away
- the (local) mux process continues to run

The Zombie process is a child of icinga, while the mux process (which is not a zombie) is a child of init.

Any ideas why this could happen? Is there perhaps something that lets the parent processes notice that there is still a running child (i.e. the mux process)?

I'll happily try out anything needed :)

Thanks,
Chris.

SEC-1948: Custom AbstractUserDetailsAuthenticationProvider Does not process annotations,"[asd](https://jira.spring.io/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=asd) (Migrated from [SEC-1948](https://jira.spring.io/browse/SEC-1948?redirect=false)) said:

I have a custom class derived from AbstractUserDetailsAuthenticationProvider which needs to use a custom dao (UserDao).  Within this provider I have an @Autowired UserDao field which does not get autowired.  UserDao is successfully autowired into other beans in the same context (all beans reside within the root context).

The hack to get it to work is to manually inject the userDao via xml configuration.  When that happens though, other annotations within UserDao (in this case @Transactional) are also removed.

multiple address models break unique related_name constraint,"I've ran into this bug while trying to run tests (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10058277/django-test-fails-when-creating-test-database/) and a user of one of my plugins has ran into it when running my migrations: https://github.com/Lacrymology/django-shop-area-tax/issues/1

The issue seems to be the existence of two models with `ForeignKey(User, related_name=""[shipping|billing]_address""..)`, i.e.: your own user-defined models and `shop.addressmodel.Address`.

Even if you don't add `shop.addressmodel` to your user models, the tests import them to use them, and then conflict arises, in the case of the bug the other user is reporting,  I'm not sure where the import's coming from.

But it has lead me to think that my own app will have the same problem, if a user wants to use the l10n app, but wants to provide their own Address model. I think I'll have to move it out of my app's models.py file, that'd do the trick, wouldn't it?

cannot extend built-in list implementation,"There are various places where we'd like to implement List&lt;E&gt;. It'd be nice to be able to extend the default growable implementation, for cases like an ObservableList where we just want to do some change tracking. This works great in other languages (e.g. Java and C#), but in Dart it has a few issues:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* the class has different names in the VM vs compiled to JS (See http://dartbug.com/949)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Even if that was fixed GrowableObjectArray can't be subclassed in the VM.

Otherwise, what we end up doing is forwarding all of the methods:

class ObservableList&lt;E&gt; implements List&lt;E&gt; {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;...&gt;

&nbsp;&nbsp;Iterator&lt;E&gt; iterator() =&gt; _items.iterator();

&nbsp;&nbsp;void forEach(void f(E element)) =&gt; _items.forEach(f);

&nbsp;&nbsp;Collection map(f(E element)) =&gt; _items.map(f);

&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;...&gt;

&nbsp;&nbsp;void operator []=(int index, E value) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_items[index] = value;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;notifyChanged(...);
&nbsp;&nbsp;}

&nbsp;&nbsp;void set length(int newLength) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_items.length = newLength;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;notifyChanged(...);
&nbsp;&nbsp;}

&nbsp;&nbsp;void add(E value) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_items.add(value);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;notifyChanged(...);
&nbsp;&nbsp;}

This has unnecessary overhead--memory for the wrapper and extra generated JS code.

"net: LookupHost(""localhost"") returning ""no such host"" error","<pre>The attached source file reproduces the issue, by simply calling LookupHost in a loop,
in a few hundred goroutines.

It seems to be related to performing a large number of (concurrent?) DNS requests, and
localhost is not the only host name it happens on. It just highlights the fact that
something is not quite right. In my case, it happened with a basic web crawler which
makes a lot of concurrent requests, and eventually it would fail to connect to a local
DB, or any other host.

This was tested on Mac OS X Lion, using the binary release of Go1.</pre>

Changing the JavaScript to target the `.searchable` class and applying that to only the title `<h2>` doesn't seem to work - I get blank results (despite the results size variable working correctly).

Surely this is a commonly desired feature? Am I doing something wrong or is this a good enhancement for this plugin?

Advanced logger implementation based on logging module ,"This PR replaces #93 and #183, and implements a logging system based on the requirements in https://github.com/astropy/astropy/wiki/Logging, discussions on the astropy-dev mailing list, and discussions in #93 and #183. I think all concerns have been addressed (though there are a few open questions below).

The current implementation relies on the logging module, and extends the Logger class to provide additional functionality, including:
- optional coloring of messages
- keeping track of the module that called the log (this adds an `origin` keyword to `LogRecord` entries)
- a context manager to capture logging entries to a list
- a context manager to write logging entries to a file
- the ability to enable/disable catching of `warnings.warn` entries
- the ability to insert entries for uncaught exceptions in the log
- the ability to control various aspects of the logging via the Astropy configuration file(s)

The following examples demonstrate the functionality: https://gist.github.com/2322952 (too many examples to show here).

If this implementation looks better than the previous PRs, then I will close #93 and #183.

Remaining open questions:
- I need to figure out how to set the origin correctly for the uncaught exceptions when catching these - any ideas?
- When we use a context manager, do we want log messages _not_ to appear in stdout?
- Do we want each sub-package in Astropy to use a different instance of the logging class, or is the current implementation fine? If the former, rather than import `logger`, modules could import `get_logger` which would return a logger with the right hierarchy (using `find_current_module`). However, this could get a bit confusing, and I'm not sure what the advantages are compared to the current implementation. Any thoughts?

Once we've converged on the API, I'll write up docs and tests (but as before, there is no point in writing these if the code and API are going to change significantly)

Let me know if you have any feedback/suggestions!

NOW() function incorrectly selected,"Disclaimer: This bug HAS already been reported ( https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=1334627&group_id=23067&atid=377408 ). However, it appears that SourceForge does not permit one to comment on bugs that have been Closed. If I am overlooking the ability to post comments to Closed issues, please forgive my ignorance.

The issue is that phpMyAdmin inserts the NOW() function's return value when inserting or updating a row, even when the NULL box is checked just to the right of the function drop-down menu.

Why is the NOW() function selected by default in the drop-down for a column whose default value is defined as NULL? The function menu should be set to [blank] when the page loads for columns whose default is NULL, and should be set to NOW() only when a selection is made from the function menu.

PMA has it almost correct; the NULL box is checked within the interface (just to the right of the function drop-down) when the column's default value is defined as NULL. So, again, why is NOW() selected in the function drop-down?

There is discussion of this issue at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6576604/mysql-phpmyadmin-timestamp-always-executes-now-function . Some snide hot-shot (Bohemian) claims that, ""Unlike other databases, in MySQL TIMESTAMP columns are ALWAYS updated with now() whenever the row is updated. This is a deliberate feature of the TIMESTAMP datatype."" Of course, there is no link to any supporting documentation, and further, the observed behavior betrays his statement (probably why his answer was voted -2). This individual failed to understand that the OP had defined the columns in question with the NULL attribute, in order to permit NULL values.

Viktor sets the record straight with the following insightful comment:

""TIMESTAMP columns are not always updated. Try creating a table with, for instance, a VARCHAR column and a TIMESTAMP column defined as NULL DEFAULT NULL. Insert a row, specifying only the VARCHAR field. The TIMESTAMP field will stay as NULL. Update the inserted row, again specifying only the VARCHAR field. Again, the TIMESTAMP will stay as NULL. Just tested with MySQL 5.1."" 

So, I did the due diligence here and read the actual documentation: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/timestamp-initialization.html . Jump down to the ""TIMESTAMP Initialization and the NULL Attribute"" section for the relevant information.

The first paragraph describes precisely the behavior that I WANT and EXPECT, and the last sentence says it all: ""If a TIMESTAMP column permits NULL values, assigning NULL sets it to NULL, not to the current timestamp.""

Further, ""A TIMESTAMP column that permits NULL values does not take on the current timestamp at insert time except under one of the following conditions: 1) Its default value is defined as CURRENT_TIMESTAMP and no value is specified for the column; 2) CURRENT_TIMESTAMP or any of its synonyms such as NOW() is explicitly inserted into the column.""

Condition 1) is not met (I have defined the default value as NULL, not CURRENT_TIMESTAMP), which seems to indicate that phpMyAdmin is, in fact, inserting CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, NOW(), etc. into the column when it should not be.

In the event that it's relevant, I roll with AJAX disabled in PMA (I find the ""light-boxed"" Create New Table interface unbearable).

STEPS TO REPRODUCE:

1.) Create a test table.

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `shr_cms_content_article` (
`id` int(9) unsigned NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
`name` varchar(255) COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci DEFAULT NULL,
`status` tinyint(1) unsigned NOT NULL DEFAULT '1',
`body` text COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci,
`slug` varchar(127) COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci DEFAULT NULL,
`timePublished` timestamp NULL DEFAULT NULL,
`timeDeleted` timestamp NULL DEFAULT NULL,
`deleter` int(9) unsigned DEFAULT NULL,
PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB  DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8 COLLATE=utf8_unicode_ci AUTO_INCREMENT=1 ;

2.) Insert data as per attached screenshot.

3.) Examine the resultant SQL:

INSERT INTO `cdmc`.`shr_cms_content_article` (
`id` ,
`name` ,
`status` ,
`body` ,
`slug` ,
`timePublished` ,
`timeDeleted` ,
`deleter`
)
VALUES (
NULL , 'Test', '1', 'Test.', 'test', NOW( ) , NOW( ) , NULL
);

Live Reload only reloads once - when using Vim,"Hi,

This fixed Live Reload for me using Vim on Linux.

Note that the patch includes my change to the live_reload.coffee file plus the make generated change to live_reload.js - let me know if you only want the coffeescript file change.
- Symptom: When using an editor (e.g. like Vim) that renames a file
  when saving changes, socketstream Live Reload will stop
  working after the first change reload.
- Change: Check for the ""rename"" event, close old watch
  and open a new watch for the file.
- Test: Besides testing functionality, run in bash:
  `ls -l /proc/<pid>/fd | grep inotify | wc -l`
  and ensure line count stays the same across multiple
  watch file changes.
  `<pid>` is the process id of the running socketstream node app.

added _.isHash function and tests," Tests if object is direct descendant of Object, such as `{}`

``` javascript
test(""objects: isHash"", function() {
  ok(_.isHash({}), '{} is object');
  ok(_.isHash({key: 'value'}), '{key: ""value""} is object');
  ok(!_.isHash(new (function Model() {})), 'new Model() is not an object');
  ok(!_.isHash([1, 2, 3]), 'and arrays');
  ok(!_.isHash($('html')[0]), 'and DOM element');
  ok(!_.isHash(iElement), 'even from another frame');
  ok(!_.isHash(function () {}), 'and functions');
  ok(!_.isHash(iFunction), 'even from another frame');
  ok(!_.isHash(null), 'but not null');
  ok(!_.isHash(undefined), 'and not undefined');
  ok(!_.isHash('string'), 'and not string');
  ok(!_.isHash(12), 'and not number');
  ok(!_.isHash(true), 'and not boolean');
});
```

This is useful for determining if an ""options hash"" is passed in a function with dynamic/overloaded arguments.  You may have a function that can take arguments like this:

``` javascript
User.create({name: 'Joe'}); // passed in an Object instance, {}
User.create([{name: 'Joe'}, {name: 'Jane'}]); // passed in an array of {} instances
User.create(new User({name: 'Joe'})); // passed in a User instance, which is a ""subclass"" of Object, but not a direct {} instance
// the complex case:
User.create(new User({name: 'Joe'}), {validate: false}); // passed in Model, which is NOT a direct {} instance, then passed in a {}.
```

If you wan't to be able to do the last case, you can't use the `_.isObject` function, you'd need to check if the object is a `{}` instance, not a subclass.  For example:

``` javascript
Model.create = function() {
  var args = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments);
  var options = _.isObject(args[args.length - 1]) ? args.pop() : {};
  // The above works in these cases:
  //
  // Model.create(model, options); // args[args.length - 1] == true
  // Model.create(options); // args[args.length - 1] == true
  // 
  // but it fails in this case:
  //
  // Model.create(model); // args[args.length - 1] == true
  //
  // The correct way to do this, is to check if it's a ""hash"":
  //
  var options = _.isHash(args[args.length - 1]) ? args.pop() : {};
  //
  // this will work in all of these cases:
  // 
  // Model.create(model, options); // args[args.length - 1] == true
  // Model.create(options); // args[args.length - 1] == true
  // Model.create(model); // args[args.length - 1] == false
}
```

allow a sudo_prefix that doesn't include sudo_prompt,"I added a NOPASSWD entry in my sudoers file to allow a particular command to be run as root. as per http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3737003/can-i-prevent-fabric-from-prompting-me-for-a-sudo-password , I had to add shell=False to run the command 'as-is'.

However, with the latest version of Fabric (1.4.0), it's not possible to prevent Fabric from passing the ""-p"" option to sudo, which makes it ask for a password even if none is needed.

I tried setting env.sudo_prefix, but this doesn't work because _sudo_prefix() in operations.py does

```
prefix = env.sudo_prefix % env.sudo_prompt
```

In other words, the sudo_prefix string has to contain a '%s' for interpolation.

Using the approach in this pull request will also make it easier to document sudo_prefix and I think making all env vars available to sudo_prefix is cool, especially since you're planning to document it (https://github.com/fabric/fabric/issues/564)

Preserve Scroll Positions,"I think this is an important feature to making pjax'd links behave closer to native full page loads. Loading a new page always scrolls you to the top and going back and forward remembers and restores you scroll position.

You'll be able to global disable it or turn it off selectively with:

``` javascript
$.pjax.defaults.preserveScrollPosition = false
```

**Implementation difficulties**

Ideally it'd be great to store `scrollPosition` along with the `pushState` state object. But we want to store the scroll position right before you navigate away, not when we changed the url. I was pretty close to coming up with something that used `replaceState` to update the current state data. That turned into a mess inside the `popstate` event since that is invoked after the url changes so theres no way to annotate the history state right before. And friggin `history.state` only works in FF not Webkit.

It will load up fine in Portrait. But if you switch to Landscape mode, then back to portrait, the video keeps the dimensions from Landscape mode??

[Add Module] Get HttpOnly Cookies,"Add Module: Get HttpOnly Cookies

As per this thread: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27972/how-do-httponly-cookies-work-with-ajax-requests

And this bug: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=380418

When that thread was written only Internet Explorer and Firefox supported the HttpOnly property so cookies with the HttpOnly property were accessible with document.cookie in all other browsers.

If I understand the bugzilla thread and the multiple edits in the op's post correctly then there's two bugs here:
- Firefox wasn't stripping HttpOnly cookies from ajax responses due to a bug.
- IE7 may have had a bug where it stripped the HttpOnly cookies from `getResponseHeader()` but not `getAllResponseHeaders()`

The module config should set ""not_working: [All]"" and specify ""working"" for the affected FF and IE versions (FF <= 1.9.1 and IE <= 7.x)

The module description should read something like: ""This module attempts to retrieve HttpOnly cookies by making an AJAX request to the domain and reading the Set-Cookie header from the response. This only works for applications where the Set-Cookie header is sent with every request.""

Kiwi matching of string and int arguments,"Hi

This is perhaps not an issue, more of a question. I wonder how Kiwi handles matching of arguments? Does it match two string objects, if they are different objects but contain the same strings? Can it match on int's as an argument?

Tried both in this matcher, but it fails, even if the string and int argument are correct:

[[mockDelegate should] receive:@selector(connectionDidSucceedWithText:andStatus:) withArguments:[testString1 stringByAppendingString:testString2],theValue(value),nil];

if testString 1 = @""a"" and testString2 = @""b"" and value = 1, then you would assume this matches connectionDidSucceedWithText:@""ab"" andStatus:1 but it does not!

"Rails projects do not work if project path contains open bracket ""[""","Rails projects do not function if they are created within a project path that contains an open bracket ""["".

Repro:

I created the following folders:

```
/coding/workspace/test1
/coding/workspace/test 2
/coding/workspace/test [3]
/coding/workspace/test [4
/coding/workspace/test ]5
/coding/workspace/test [6/subfolder
```

Within each of them, I created a new Rails project using ""rails new hello_world"". I then cd'ed into the hello_world project folder and ran ""rails server"". Lastly I loaded http://localhost:3000/ in a web browser.

Rails projects within folders 1,2,5 work just fine (they display ""public/index.html""), while Rails projects within folders 3,4,6 do not work. Specifically, they return the following error instead of displaying the smoke test ""public/index.html"":

```
Routing Error

No route matches [GET] ""/""
Try running rake routes for more information on available routes.
```

I have confirmed that the projects are created correctly, by diff'ing a working and non-working project:

```
$ diff -r */hello_world
diff -r test [4/hello_world/config/initializers/secret_token.rb test1/hello_world/config/initializers/secret_token.rb
7c7
< HelloWorld::Application.config.secret_token = 'e84be29ba3ae3fc8a69f44b66e03070e0ef7fbd329816d7dd8ba7f9c0b0bd637480370794a1acf58eed4eda9dd92ca67a1f7784d54241d4b0dfb1a8011c0c3a2'

"TimeZone.parse should use zone information in the input string, when available","On the server where system timezone is say, CDT,

```
Time.zone.parse(""Mon May 28 2012 00:00:00 GMT-0700 (PDT)"")
 => Mon, 28 May 2012 05:00:00 UTC +00:00

whereas, 

```
""Mon May 28 2012 00:00:00 GMT-0700 (PDT)"".to_datetime
 => Tue, 29 May 2012 00:00:00 -0700 
```

.. produces the correct value.

Is there a good reason why TimeZone.parse is ignoring time-zone information available in the input string? Shouldn't it behave the same as if we had use the string.to_datetime method?

The current implementation suggests that a caller should set Time.zone to the correct value first, before invoking parse, but this seems like an unnecessary step when the information needed is available in the input string itself.
#### Additional information

The date format is used by chrome, safari and mozilla when serializing a javascript Date object to string. IE(9) ues a different format like `Mon May 28 00:00:00 PDT 2012` which is correctly handled by the default Time.zone.parse implementation.

Ability to pass a custom parameter to ClientBoostrap.connect(),"It would be great if I could pass an argument to the ClientBoostrap.connect so it will be passed to PipelineFactory.getPipeline so I could use it in my ChannelHandler constructor, example : 

<pre>
// the main:
boostrap.connect(sockAddr,theMissingParameter);

// in the pipeline
public class CrawlerPipelineFactory  implements ChannelPipelineFactory {
    // passed in ClientBoostrap.connect()
    public ChannelPipeline getPipeline(Object theMissingParameter) throws Exception {
        return Channels.pipeline( MyHandler(theMissingParameter));
    }

in my opinion It's really a missing feature, because when you need to have some extra information in your handler before the connection is made, it most of the time involves hacks or adding critical section, see the thread here :

MySQL -> FITS doesn't work for string columns,"I am using atpy to dump MySQL tables to FITS. Sometimes if there are string columns the resulting FITS file is corrupt, even though there is no warning from atpy.

Here's a small test case that shows the problem on my machine:

``` python

opts = dict(host=xxx, user=xxx, passwd=xxx, db=xxx)

from atpy import Table
name = 'atpy_test'
# Create an example table in a MySQL database
table = Table(name=name)
#table.add_column('int_col', [1])
table.add_column('string_col', ['one'])
table.write('mysql', overwrite=True, **opts)
table.write('table.fits', overwrite=True)
print type(table.data), type(table.data[0]), table.data
# Read table from MySQL database and write to FITS file
table2 = Table('mysql', table=name, **opts)
table2.write('table2.fits', overwrite=True)
print type(table2.data), type(table2.data[0]), table2.data
```

The output:

``` text
<type 'numpy.ndarray'> <type 'numpy.void'> [('one',)]
<type 'numpy.ndarray'> <type 'numpy.void'> [('one',)]
```

And here's what ftverify has to say:

``` text
$ ftverify table2.fits 

               ftverify 4.16 (CFITSIO V3.290)

```

Note that `table.fits` is OK according to ftverify. atpy can open `table2.fits` for this case, but for my actual data atpy can't open the FITS file it wrote (is this AttributeError a separate issue?):

ftverify shows many errors, here's the first few:

```

"_log_query method raises a warning when query contains ""%""","## Issue

When logging is on:

> ORM::configure('logging', true);

Queries containing the ""%"":

> $many = Model::factory('user')->where(""active"",1)->where_raw('username like ""ben<b><i>%</i></b>""')->find_many();

Raise PHP warning:

> Warning:  vsprintf() : Too few arguments in idiorm.php on line 267

Because % must be escaped in the query for vsprintf.
## Fix

In idiorm.php, line 264:

> $query = str_replace(""?"", ""%s"", $query);

should be:

> $query = str_replace(""?"", ""%s"", str_replace(""%"",""%%"",$query));

This fixes the problem for the ""%"" chars.
## Second issue

The problem remains with the ""?"" char inside the query:

> $many = Model::factory('book')->where(""active"",1)->where_raw('comments like ""has been released<b><i>?</i></b>%""')->find_many();

vsprintf raises the same error.

I'm using an iPhone 4 device running iOS 5.1which from my understanding wouldn't be able to process the high res image returned from AVCaptureStillImageOutput since one of there dimension is bigger than 2048px.
To adress this I was planning to resize the image on an iPhone4 to 2048x1529px (3.1MP) from the original resolution of 2592x1936. (5MP)

Provide an easy way to detect if an application is launched for the first time,"There is multiple way to know if an activity is launched for the first time.

Here is an example :
http://stackoverflow.com/a/7238549/392508

It would be more conveniant if AndroidAnnotations could provide a new annotation to detect this behavior.

Something like this : 

``` java
@OnFirstLaunch 
public void onFirstLaunch() {
    // The code here
}
```

To make this, we have to answer some questions : 
- When the callback is called ? after or before onCreate ?
- Where this annotation can be used ? (EApplication, EActivity, EBean ?)
- What could be the name of the annotation ? @OnFirstLaunch @FirstLaunch @FirstCreated 
- Which method will we use to detect first launch ? creation of a file on the FS, SharedPreferences, etc ... ?

When I completely remove rails_admin, the failures on 1.8.7 go away.

Possibility of creating multiple custom @RequestCondition,"I've already started to use my own implementation of `@RequestCondition`, named `@SubdomainMapping`

http://stackoverflow.com/a/10336769/492624

On the link above, you can find my code, until I move it to some compacted Spring MVC project on Github

As of now, we have to use subclass of `RequestMappingHandlerMapping`.

Used `@Override` functions are `getCustomTypeCondition`, `getCustomMethodCondition` can return only single custom @RequestCondition, Is it already possible to return multiple of them? 

I don't currently think so, so I created JIRA issue SPR-9350 ( https://jira.springsource.org/browse/SPR-9350 ).
If I'm mistaken, please let me know, so I can get rid of it.

Reversing regular expressions,"We have <code>str_</code> generator for producing arbitrary strings but this doesn't give enough of a control on the string's form.

A quick search doesn't yield any ready-made Python library for that, but this StackOverflow answer seems useful: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/492716/reversing-a-regular-expression-in-python . Other than that, we could also have a look at Django's <code>reverse</code> function.

Rails assets pipeline returns 13-lines empty javascript with &body=1,"Reference : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10301129/rails-3-2-asset-pipeline-adds-body-1-but-serve-empty-resource

I'm no Rails Assets expert, but in the last few days, I've been getting this strange behavior, where 
127.0.0.1:3000/assets/twitter/bootstrap.js?body=1 
==> returns an empty file (13 lines)

Without the query string, it works.

Using Rails 3.2.1. Same behavior with Rails 3.2.2

craueFormFlowBundle and ajax : dynamic form,"Hello,

I am having troubles using craueFormFlowBundle combined with an ajax/jquery call to customize the form.
Is that something that can be done ?
I want my radioBox input to be function of the choice of a select, both in the same step.
The error I get is ""This form should not contain extra fields"". ( i am including the stepField.html.twig file)
How come is that ? I am not adding any new input field inside the form, only replacing input tags with new ones i get from the ajax function, so it should be working.

The problem occurs at step 4, so there is no need to check the other steps.

"Sometimes, when our client enters a new title for a locale, it doesn't save","I'm at a loss on this one. I've been trying to investigate it for a couple of days now and I don't have an answer.

At http://drlinde.com, our client will enter the title for a page in a different locale and the change won't be saved. The fallback german will still appear in the navigation.

If we db:pull, the data is there and the navigation works correctly. We're not using any caching, as far as I can tell... plus they wait more than a day and the change still doesn't propagate.

I tried switching from @page.title to @page.translation.title but that isn't proving to be the correct answer

I've found that there are some duplicate translations in the db, one with a nil :title and the other with the correct :title, and for some reason @page.translation_for(locale) picks the nil one every time, therefore it fallsback to the default locale.

A workaround is to pass ""int"" instead of ""float"". I modified ""performOffsetDelegate"" to take an ""int"" offset and valid values do return. Perhaps a better way of doing this is to use ""performSelector"" and pass objects around.

Strange pause at the end of a loop,"Hi guys,

I created a SO Question with a JSFiddle, but got no useful response (one answer deleted by the author after realising that the wait(100) calls in my code make sense.)

Here is my question: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10307411/pause-after-loop-in-tweenjs

I basically create a loop with a number of waits, but at the end of the loop there is an even longer wait, I didn't create, which I'd like to get rid of somehow. If there is no default wait at the end of a looping tween, this might be a bug in tweenjs.

Patch to allow errorClass to contain spaces,"I happened to need errorClass to be ""message validation"", and this resulted in an extra error message being added every time that validation was triggered. Here is a patch that fixes it:

Change line 473 (of jquery.validate.js version 1.9.0) :
            return $( this.settings.errorElement + ""."" + this.settings.errorClass, this.errorContext );

to the following:
            return $( (this.settings.errorElement + ""."" + this.settings.errorClass).replace(/\s+/g, '.'), this.errorContext );

This change basically replaces every space with a '.' character, following the lead of the solution posted here:

Use the right ~/.gitconfig when running under ~/.sudo_bashrc,"When you sudo to root, it should pull in $STDIN_OWNERS_HOME/.gitconfig instead of ~root/.gitconfig.

Currently, there's no clear way to do this:

- http://man.cx/git-config#heading5
- http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/issues/detail?id=497

The closest I can think of is:

```
git() {
    HOME=$STDIN_OWNERS_HOME command git ""$@""
}
```

(ie. do the $HOME hack, but _only_ when running the 'git' command)  However, that has the downside that any program that would get spawned by git (eg. external merge, external diff) would behave wonky.

Surely, there's SOME way to do this?

"""uninitialized constant"" error when running in Rails 3.2.3 engine","I've generated my Rails application as a mountable engine using this command:

```
rails plugin new [plugin name] --mountable
```

In `[plugin name].gemspec`, I added validates_timeliness as a dependency:

```
s.add_dependency 'validates_timeliness'
```

I then ran `bundle install` and `rails g validates_timeliness:install`.

When I try running an RSpec test, `rails server`, `rake routes`, or anything involving my Rails app, I get this error:

```
/path/to/config/initializers/validates_timeliness.rb:1: uninitialized constant ValidatesTimeliness (NameError)
```

I've tried running the install script in both the engine's root as well as in `spec/dummy`, but both cause the error. The only way to get on with life is to remove the initializer and any `validates_date` calls from my models.

Any ideas? I'd be glad to help debug, but I must warn you that I am trying to learn Rails at the same time.

I can easily understand how is the custom `@RoleMapping` in custom `RequestCondition` implemented.

https://github.com/plataformatec/devise/wiki/How-To:-Use-SSL-(HTTPS)

I added
    #in config/environments/production.rb
    config.to_prepare { Devise::SessionsController.force_ssl }
    config.to_prepare { Devise::RegistrationsController.force_ssl }

then i followed the gist:
https://gist.github.com/1040964

to change back to http. Everything works fine until the user tries to logout with session#destory. Thats when things go wrong. 
apparently this guy has the same problem:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9527158/how-should-i-go-about-making-all-devise-paths-use-https?answertab=oldest#tab-top

What i ended up doing now is to not redirect back to http after sign in. and everything is https when user is signed in. this way the sign out will work fine. However, it will not work if some how the user close the browser, then open it back up in http. if the user is in http, clicking sign out will cause the system to crash. sign out only works when the request comes from http.

Possibility to add function on modal show/hide,"I made a login modal and used the tooltip plugin to show errors for invalid fields. I wanted the errors to stay until the error was resolved. So i added the trigger 'manuel' and that works just fine. Problem is when i now close the modal i have no chance to remove the tooltips and they stay at the exact position of the page. Also in case this happens and the user later reopens the modal, i want to show the error-tooltips again. I got this working by adding additional click-handler to the data-dismiss link and the link opening the modal (but it wasn't working with fadein animation), but maybe that would be a nice feature to add.

thx for the great work! Florian

Base64 Android worries,"The new dependency on apache commons codec 1.6 won't work on Android b/c Android contains an undocumented older version of apache commons codec, probably version 1.3. (WTF!!) This older version doesn't have the Base64.encodeBase64String method.

What will happen is that the internal version of the Base64 class will be loaded as a priority over the 1.6 version included by Clutch when the Base64 class is referenced, and then Clojure will look for the encodeBase64String and can't find it.
You could possibly get away with including commons codec 1.3 in Clutch, or include 1.6 but only use 1.3 methods, but the whole thing is messy. Would be nice to have a Clojure 1.2 compatible data.codec or what to keep things clean.

Also the clutch HTTP stuff still references sun.misc.Base64 but I guess that will go away as part of moving to clj_http.

here is the entire log:

Ideally, the following assets should be added into asset path, so they get autocompiled by asset pipeline when assets:precompile rake task is executed.

Currently this does not happen & hence it needs fixing by adding assets to correct path

Support for Xcode's workspaces,"When running `calabash-ios setup` the setup opens Xcode's  *.xcodeproj project file. Since more and more devs using CocoaPods these days, they're also using *.xcworkspace. So when the setup program instructs to verify that the `-cal` target is building, it will fail since the linker is unable to link the static pods library. You'll see a `-lPods` error message.

So I purpose to look for a *.xcworkspace file and if it exists open it by the end of the setup procedure.

Get SSL Working,"I believe that logins are, by default, not encrypted, which is probably bad.  As a result, we should probably make the login page, at a minimum, SSL encrypted.  Gandi provides certificates.  There's a guide at http://wiki.gandi.net/en/ssl.  I (Sam) filed the CSR already.  

A guide on adding a cert to apache is at http://wiki.gandi.net/en/hosting/using-linux/tutorials/ubuntu/ssl

All of the files that you need are in /home/samking/ssl-stuff.  They aren't all visible to everyone (for security reasons), so you'll need to sudo to copy them to where they need to go.

It will probably require some Apache configuration.  Make sure that you don't do anything you can't undo in case you break the site.

WIP - Notes,"Hi, I started working on git notes. Here is the first draft, more to follow soon.

One of the issue I'm foreseeing, is about how to get all notes, from all namespaces (similar to the git log --show-notes=*). I don't know of a good way to do this (iterating through the refs first to find all the refs/notes/xxx ones?), so if you have an idea, feel free to share it!

Also, in terms of API, I was thinking about making Notes its own class (inheriting from IEnumerable), so that I could have the Delete and Modify methods on it.

Somehow, matlab2tikz is not able to process >>plot3(xvector,yvector,zvector)<< matlab commands.

Even the most simple example does not work:

% ###################################################################

x = rand(100,1)_4-2;
y = rand(100,1)_4-2;
z = x.*exp(-x.^2-y.^2);

% Construct the interpolant
% F = TriScatteredInterp(x,y,z,'nearest');
% F = TriScatteredInterp(x,y,z,'natural');
F = TriScatteredInterp(x,y,z,'linear');

% Evaluate the interpolant at the locations (qx, qy), qz
%    is the corresponding value at these locations.
ti = -2:.25:2;
[qx,qy] = meshgrid(ti,ti);
qz = F(qx,qy);

hold on
surf(qx,qy,qz)
plot3(x,y,z,'o')
view(gca,[-69 14]);
hold off

matlab2tikz( 'testplot3D.tikz', 'height', '\plothoehe', 'width', '\plotbreite', 'parseStrings', false);

% ###################################################################

I hope, someone can help me. Thanks a lot

Cheers, Andi

Move contents of library reference into individual modules.,"The library reference documentation currently exists in doc/source/libref.rst.  The majority of the contents of that file is duplicated in the docstrings of the individual classes.  It should be consolidated into one place to ease future maintenance.  

Also, the library reference should be split over several pages to make it easier to navigate.

OU Wiki for Moodle 2 throwing database write error,"Hi:

My installation of OU Wiki for Moodle 2 has just started throwing a database write error whenever I try to save any changes to any page. All the other OU Wiki functionality seems to be working OK; just saving changes produces this error. Changes are not saved. Please see attached screenshot for the debugging stack trace information for errors thrown by OU Wiki for Moodle 2 version 2012030700 in my Moodle forum post here > http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=200076#p872692

This error appears to have started after I successfully performed a weekly upgrade to Moodle 2.2.2+ (Build: 20120329) from the previous week's 2.2.2+ build. (I've been running Moodle 2.2.2+ on a VPS with Linux CentOS and MySQL.) I had OU Wiki for Moodle 2 version 2011112900 installed at the time (which had been functioning without any problems previously), so I uninstalled that older version (after backing up and then deleting the few OU Wiki instances I had already created).

(During the uninstalling process, I did notice that simply clicking the Delete button from the Manage Activities page did remove OU Wiki from the list of installed modules. However, when I manually inspected my database, I found the 8 mod_ouwiki tables still in the database. The tables were empty but had not been dropped from the database. I manually dropped the empty mdl_ouwiki tables from the database. I also manually deleted the mod/ouwiki directory. Seemed like a clean uninstall at that point.)

Then I uploaded and installed the latest version 2012030700 found at https://github.com/moodleou/moodle-mod_ouwiki . Installation was successful and I could create a new OU Wiki instance in a test course without problem. However, when I attempt to create a new Start Page by saving a bit of simple text content, I get exactly the same database write error with version 2012030700 as I did with the older version 2011112900.

Is anyone else experiencing this problem? Thanks!

I think I'm *this* close to linking glfw under Windows (mingw64) -- anyone can help me out?,"Your glfw package was working very well for me under Linux, but my GPU driver there was so slow, I have to move to Win. Now with things like cygwin and mingw, not a big deal -- I still get a decent dev environment even under  Win.

Now first off, I have built from scratch: libglfw.a, glfw.dll and glfwdll.a on my Win7 64bit system. I have placed them in every sub-folder under \mingw64 and \go that contains .a files (and the dll under windows and system32). Same for GL/glfw.h -- copied it to all ""include"" sub-folders under mingw64; plus \go\include.

Now first I did go-get github.com/jteeuwen/glfw -- no problems.

Tried to compile testdata/simplewindow/main.go with 6g -- no problems.

Linking of course failed -- 6l with the output file of the above 6g file. The well-known output, people have gotten this under Linux and Mac OS according to previous GitHub Issues for glfw:

```

Now I looked at your glfw.go file... I'm not an expert in cgo, c or ld but I tried the following modification (adding a new line with LDFLAGS for windows) at the top of the file where the #cgo flags go:

```
//#cgo windows  CFLAGS: -I/Go/include // unmodified
//#cgo windows LDFLAGS: -L/mingw64/lib -lmingw32 -lglfw -lglfwdll -lglu32 -lopengl32 -mwindows
//#include <stdlib.h> // unmodified
//#include <GL/glfw.h> // unmodified
import ""C"" // unmodified
```

Saved the modification, deleted the \go\pkg\github.com\jteeuwen\glfw\ and did another go-get -- since the glfw folders were still there under \go\src\pkg with my modified glfw.go, go-get did not refetch this and simply did another build with my modification. No complaints either, it created a new glfw.a binary under \go\pkg\github.com\jteeuwen\glfw\ -- I was so hopeful!

Yet, I'm still getting the same errors. What could this be? The linker is now given proper flags and paths, no? What could I be missing here? Would love to hear some ideas.

Sparkleshare continuously showing conflicts,"I'm using SparkleShare 0.8.4 for Mac, with our own git back end on a private server. There are consistent problems with the push/pull mechanism such that if user A modifies a file, SparkleShare detects the change and commits as you would expect, but the push to the master doesn't appear to work. If you run git status within the folder, it shows the local repo is ahead by x commits.
User B, in the meantime doesn't seem to get the changes made by user A.

I've looked at the debug.log file, and what seems to happen is that SparkleShare uses the ssh:user@server.com/path url in the remote repo commands. I tried executing these commands within the folder manually, and after the command has been completed the git status still reports x commits ahead. However if I take the same command and replace the ssh url with 'origin', when the command has finished, git status reports that the repo is in sync. I should also note that in either case git itself doesn't report any error with the commit, so SparkleShare has no information to detect a problem.

I think the fact that the push is not working correctly is what leads to these conflicts occurring, as each person's repo can then get out of sync as local changes are not pushed to the server repo.

I checked out a copy of SparkleShare and built a version changing SparkleRepoGit.cs so that is used 'origin' instead of the URL, to see if it made a difference, and I think it does, but that was a quick change to test rather than a proper solution, so I'm reporting the issue here to see if it can be reproduced and a proper fix created.
